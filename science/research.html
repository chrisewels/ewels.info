		<h2>Nanotube based composites</h2>
		<p align="justify">Carbon nanotubes are the flagship in the new world of
		nanotechnology research - molecular tubes of carbon their strength is
		theoretically 100 times that of steel with only one sixth of the weight.
		One of their first promising applications will be in composite materials -
		what if we could add them to plastics, ceramics and metals we currently
		use, and find these materials suddenly stronger, harder, tougher?  With
		other added benefits (electrical conductivity, improved thermal conductance)
		then suddenly we could have lighter more efficient planes, cheaper more
		efficient cars, bridges that could span vast distances, earthquake 'proof'
		buildings, etc.</p>
		<p align="justify">In reality we still have a few hurdles to overcome -
		nanotubes often prefer to stick to each other rather than the material we add
		them to, they are still expensive (but getting cheaper), and we need
		to improve our techniques for lining them up and effectively binding them
		to their host material.</p>
		<p align="justify">In my composites work we are experimenting with all of
		this, using surfactants to improve the mixing of the nanotubes, testing various
		mechanical routes to align the tubes in the composite, various mechanical
		testing techniques to assess the improvement in material properties after
		adding the nanotubes, and state-of-the-art microscopy to see and understand
		what's happening in these new materials at the molecular scale.</p>

        <h2><a href="presentations/Poster_IWFAC2001.pdf">Nanoengineering : Shape
          change in carbon materials</a></h2>
        <p align="justify">As we develop an increasing range of carbon structures with wide ranging
        properties, we need to address the dynamics - how do such systems form
        and evolve? How do they restructure under external factors such as applied
        stress, irradiation, or heating? </p>
        <p align="justify"> In this work we explore the behaviour of point defects
          such as ad-atoms, vacancies and impurity atoms, as well as topological
          defects such as disclinations, dislocations and dislocation dipoles,
          in carbon systems [2]. Using supercomputer modelling techniques (density
          functional theory) we examine their structure, the nature of their interaction,
          and try to determine low energy transformation paths between various
          configurations. </p>
        <p align="justify"> Recent work has led to the discovery of a <I>catalysed
          exchange process</I> in carbon networks, whereby a single carbon ad-atom
          can aid Stone Wales type bond rotations, lowering the migration barrier
          by a factor of about four. This leads to qualitatively different behaviour
          [1]. </p>
        <p align="justify"> The discovery has important implications for many
           carbon systems including the formation of C<sub>60</sub>, the growth
            and distortion of nanotubes and buckyonions, and the behaviour of
           graphite
          under irradiation. (<a href="presentations/Poster_IWFAC2001.pdf">poster</a>).</p>

        <h2>Mechano-chemistry : Hydrogen in silicon and diamond</h2>
        <p  align="justify">Conventional theory says that pre-existing dislocations
          can move through a semiconductor, sweeping up impurities as they pass.
          Meanwhile other impurities can diffuse through the lattice to the dislocations.
          In this way impurities modify the behaviour of pre-existing dislocation
          structures and hence affect material plasticity. Our latest work in
          the field of hydrogen impurities in silicon and diamond is pointing
          to a radical new field of <I>mechano-chemistry</I>. In this case impurities
          are able to <I>nucleate</I> dislocations, and propagate their growth;
          <I>i.e.</I> the impurities both initiate and control plastic behaviour
          in a material. </p>
        <p align="justify"> Hydrogen is a very important impurity in both diamond
          and silicon, yet little is known about it since it is so hard to detect.
          Hydrogen is deliberately implanted into silicon during the <I>smart
          cut process</I>, where implantation occurs at a fixed depth, the silicon
          sample is annealed, and then fractures along the implantation plane,
          giving an atomically smooth hydrogenated surface. The mechanism for
          this process is not properly understood. In silicon the behaviour of
          dislocations has been studied before and after deliberate hydrogen introduction;
          both the pre-factor and the activation energy for motion change radically.
          Hence hydrogen can change the plasticity of silicon. </p>
        <p align="justify"> Our early investigations of H interaction with dislocations
          showed that H binds strongly to dislocations, and modifies the atomic
          rearrangements necessary for their motion. These results were in quantitative
          agreement with the shifts observed in experiment [1]. </p>
        <p align="justify"> In later work we extended this to dislocation behaviour
          in diamond [2], which again shows interesting changes in behaviour.
          This may have implications for processing of artificial diamonds. </p>
        <p align="justify"> Our current research is following two directions. Firstly we are developing
          <I>LINEWISE</I>, a kinetic monte carlo simulation of dislocations in
          semiconductors. We are feeding into this the results of our high level
          density functional calculations, and using LINEWISE to study the dynamics
          of dislocation motion in different regimes. The other research centres
          on further studies of dislocation nucleation and growth in the presence
          of hydrogen. </p>
        <P align="justify"> Mechano-chemistry may well explain unusual behaviour in other materials,
          such as sudden quartz fracture deep in the earth's core, occurring during
          earthquakes (quartz is often the first material to break, despite its
          extreme hardness). We are also interested in sudden failure in ice,
          for example fracture leading to avalanche. It is clear that this is
          an interesting new line of research that could shed light on many previously
          unexplained materials phenomena. </p>
