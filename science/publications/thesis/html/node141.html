Di-y-lid is TD3 - a parallel process</A>
</H2>
<P>
A second possibility is that the di-y-lid is actually TD3, and both
TD1 and TD2 are pre-cursors to the di-y-lid.  Therefore, being
bistable isomers, TD1 and TD2 have to be different forms of
electrically active trimer.
<P>
In this case, the initial 1.2&nbsp;eV formation energy of TD1 could be
explained as a barrier to internal restructure of the trimer.  If the
dimer is able to migrate to O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and form a weakly bound trimer, in
the initial material there is already a small pool of trimers (there
are also some early thermal donors present).  These trimers can
restructure with a barrier of 1.2&nbsp;eV.  Once these are exhausted, the
limiting barrier becomes the trimer formation barrier, <I>i.e.</I> the
dimer migration barrier of 1.7&nbsp;eV.  In addition both TD1 and TD2 have
an electrically inactive form, with LVMs different to those of the
trimer.  Thus there has to be a third form for the trimer, although
this form may be much higher in energy than the others and therefore
only frozen in at lower temperatures.
<P>
In such a scheme, presumably TD1 and TD2 could remain in dynamic
equilibrium with the inactive trimer form.  There are two ways of
forming the 4O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> di-y-lid.  Either the trimers could migrate, or
else they could be only weakly stable and so break into dimers and
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, so that dimers would eventually meet each other and bind into
the di-y-lid.  Markevich found his concentration models for the dimer
and trimer fitted experiment much better if he assumed a mobile
trimer, and such a mechanism would lead to faster di-y-lid formation
given the relatively high concentration of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> compared to O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB>.
<P>
This also helps to account for the relative TD concentrations.  TD3 is
the primary TD.  If both TD1 and TD2 are mobile, they can form through
dimer addition to O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  TD3 can then form by trimer addition to
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  However, if TD3 is immobile, it cannot migrate to O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> is only moving very slowly on the timescales considered, and
thus in order to form higher order TDs, TD3 has to rely on dimers
migrating to it; therefore the formation process will slow
considerably.  Hence there will tend to be a build up of TD3 species.
<P>
Against this argument is the necessity that there has to be dimers
present in the material to bond with the higher order TDs.  However if
dimers are reacting with O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> to form trimers, that should rapidly
take most dimers out of circulation.  This could still be consistent
with the above model if the trimer binding energy is so small that the
dimers only bond briefly, and most trimers dissociate before forming
any of the thermal donors.
<P>
The crux of this model then seems to be that TD1 and TD2 form in <I>
parallel</I> with the main formation scheme, which is dimers to trimers,
and on to the di-y-lid as TD3.  However in this form it is not
consistent with annealing studies (see
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node83.html#fig:hallberg_data">6.11</A>).  In the 450<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C plot, it can be
seen that the TD3 absorption exactly maps that of the trimer.  This is
consistent with a scheme where the trimer migrates to O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> to form a
di-y-lid TD3.  However, the TD2 signal rises rapidly in line with the
dimer concentration to begin with, and then tails off after two hours,
until it has almost disappeared after 10 hours or so.  If TD1/2 were
isomers of the trimer, we might expect the change in their absorption
to roughly match that of the trimer, which is not the case.
<P>
However this might be understood if the conditions in the material
change to make the switch from trimer to TD1/2 less favourable.  As
the anneal progresses increasing numbers of TDs are produced, which
should lead to a shift in the Fermi level.  This could shift the
relative stability of the trimer and TD1/2, making TD1/2 less
favourable.  In the first 3 hours of annealing at 450<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C the
trimer peak appears to remain roughly constant, whereas the TD2 peak
roughly traces that of the dimer.  Thereafter the trimer peak starts
to increase while TD2 drops away (see Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node83.html#fig:hallberg_data">6.11</A>).
We would expect the combined signal from the trimer, TD1 and TD2 to
roughly correlate with the dimer; in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node83.html#fig:hallberg_data">6.11</A>b,
this appears qualitatively to be the case.
<P>
This idea is supported by results from samples subjected to dispersal
treatment [<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_94">271</A>], where during subsequent annealing
the decrease in the 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> band correlates with the growth of
the 1006 and 975&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> bands.  From these results it appears that
TD1 forms simultaneously with the trimers, but as soon as the donor
concentration starts to creep up, the TD1 transform into TD2.  From
this we might tentatively suggest that TD1 is closer in structure to
the trimer, and is slightly less stable than TD2.
