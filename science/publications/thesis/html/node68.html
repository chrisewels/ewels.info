<P>
The results give strong support to the idea [<A
 HREF="node149.html#corbett_64b">141</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#lindstrom_86">90</A>]
that VO<SUB><I>n</I></SUB> complexes preferentially form during annealing of
irradiated O-rich Si. The VO<SUB>2</SUB> defect gives three IR active modes
but only one has been detected. VO<SUB>3</SUB> gives three high frequency LVMs
which have all been detected.  V<SUB><I>n</I></SUB>O complexes on the other hand give
modes close to VO, <I>i.e.</I> around 830 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.  VO<SUB>2</SUB> appears to
have no connection with TDs [<A
 HREF="node149.html#lindstrom_86">90</A>] but may be a nucleus for
oxygen precipitation.
<P>
One of the remaining questions is why [O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>] does not decrease when
VO anneals out at 350<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$"> and VO<SUB>2</SUB> is formed.  We originally
proposed this was due to oxygen dimers [<A
 HREF="node149.html#ewels_95">99</A>] complexing
with vacancies, and recent work by Londos <I>et al</I>
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#londos_NATO">79</A>] seems to confirm this.  The third, slow, formation
process for VO<SUB>2</SUB> occurs while VO levels remain relatively static,
suggesting that this is not a VO transformation process.  It is known
that vacancy aggregates exist in the material and frequently release
and re-trap isolated vacancies.  It therefore seems likely that these
isolated vacancies in the structure are soaking up oxygen dimers.
Alternatively there could be a breakdown of VO centres as they trap
dimers, and the release of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> through this mechanism roughly
balances the loss of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> through trapping of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> by VO centres.
<P>
Different treatments will place different emphasis on each reaction
step, but it now seems that the following processes contribute to the
breakdown of VO and the formation of VO<SUB>2</SUB> (the numbering
corresponding to the three regimes discussed in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node60.html#sec:formation">5.1.2</A>):

Processes such as

<P>
are unlikely due to the low concentration of VO centres as compared to
other defects such as O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  Note that unlike normal Cz-Si there will
be a large number of Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> present in this material due to the
irradiation.  This complex behaviour of VO destruction and VO<SUB>2</SUB>
formation provides strong evidence for the presence of interstitial
oxygen dimers in Cz-Si, since without them it is difficult to explain
the observed reaction processes.
<P>
There is also some uncertainty about the formation kinetics of the
VO<SUB>3</SUB> defects.  Corbett et al [<A
 HREF="node149.html#corbett_64b">141</A>] pointed out that the
growth of the VO<SUB>3</SUB> bands was anomalously fast and required either a
very non-uniform distribution of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> or a diffusivity of VO<SUB>2</SUB>
higher than that of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>. However more recent work by Lindstr&#246;m
<I>et al</I> [<A
 HREF="node149.html#lindstrom_86">90</A>] states that the activation energy for
the growth of VO<SUB>3</SUB> is close to that of the diffusion of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>,
suggesting that O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> diffuses to immobile VO<SUB>2</SUB>.  If Corbett is
correct there could naturally be O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> present quite close to many of
the VO<SUB>2</SUB> centres.  This could occur by
<P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG WIDTH="318" HEIGHT="29"
 SRC="img237.gif"
 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
\rm VO +O_{2i} \rightleftharpoons V + O_i + O_{2i} \rightarrow VO_2
+ O_i \end{displaymath}"></P>
<P>
which could leave the O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> quite close to the VO<SUB>2</SUB> centre.  An
alternative is that VO<SUB>2</SUB> is breaking down to VO and then trapping a
dimer before the VO can lose its second oxygen.  The activation energy
observed by Lindstr&#246;m is then actually the activation energy for the
formation of the dimers in the first place, since once formed they can
rapidly migrate to these VO centres.  It seems a new study of the
growth of VO<SUB>3</SUB> is called for which should also include the effects
of mobile dimers.
<P>
Finally we note that when O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> is complexed with a defect imposing
tensile strain on the lattice, such as VO, N<SUB>2</SUB> [<A
 HREF="node149.html#rasmussen_95">100</A>] or C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB>
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#kaneta_92">101</A>], the O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>-related LVM is reduced from 1136 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> to
around 1000&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.  TDs also have modes in this region [<A
 HREF="node149.html#lindstrom_94">102</A>]
and this suggests that they might consist of O atoms surrounding a
core which gives rise to tensile strain.  This need not be a vacancy,
as many defects such as interstitial N<SUB>2</SUB> pairs [<A
 HREF="node149.html#jones_94c">103</A>], C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#jones_92b">104</A>] and Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> [<A
 HREF="node149.html#deak_92">105</A>] can also give dilated Si-Si
bonds.  This will be discussed further in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node116.html#thermal">9</A>.
