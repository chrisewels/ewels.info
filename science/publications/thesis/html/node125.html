Discussion of the di-y-lid model</A>
</H2>
 <A NAME="sec:csuppres">&#160;</A>
The di-y-lid model is consistent with a wide range of experimental
thermal donor observations, many of which have been discussed above.
<P>
Firstly it contains four oxygen atoms in agreement with early oxygen
loss experiments [<A
 HREF="node149.html#kaiser_58">179</A>].  It consists of a pair of dimers,
consistent with dimer formation being the low temperature rate
limiting step[<A
 HREF="node149.html#mcquaid_95">143</A>].  It has the correct C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> symmetry
with all O atoms in the same <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;plane, and none of them on the
C<SUB>2</SUB> axis.  In addition it contains only one Si atom on the C<SUB>2</SUB>
core which is displaced significantly from its ideal lattice site
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#spaeth_NATO">231</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#michel_89">232</A>].  The donor activity arises from O instead of
a single Si atom in agreement with ENDOR[<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_NATO">10</A>].  The
defect has two shells of O nuclei [<A
 HREF="node149.html#michel_89">232</A>] corresponding to the
trivalent and then divalent O atoms.  It exhibits the correct
compressive and tensile properties along the various <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;directions[<A
 HREF="node149.html#watkins_NATO">236</A>].
<P>
The defect gives rise to the correct number of vibrational modes, with
both absolute values and isotope shifts extremely close to those
experimentally observed[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>].  Since it consists of a
pair of dimers, its entire formation path can consist of dimer
migration and addition, hence the formation barrier is always 1.7&nbsp;eV
and never needs to involve isolated O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.
<P>
It should have an associated inactive form where the two trivalent O
atoms become divalent once again; this could either relax back into
two dimers separated by a pair of Si-Si bonds, or else into a central
dimer flanked by two O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms separated by a single empty Si-Si
bond (with further structural rearrangement it is possible to imagine
other inactive forms).  A final alternative is if the two trivalent O
atoms form next-neighbour bonds along <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;, while the top two Si
atoms form a stronger bond which when H passivated could be inactive
(see below).  The modes of this inactive form might be expected to be
slightly higher than isolated dimers given their proximity;
experimentally whereas the dimer absorbs at 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> the
inactive TD form absorbs at 1020&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> [<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>],
consistent with this interpretation.
<P>
In agreement with stress induced alignment[<A
 HREF="node149.html#watkins_NATO">236</A>] the
defect should be able to reorient within about five `standard' O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
hops, if some of the motion is coupled and slightly faster.  For
example, the two core O atoms initially perform a `coupled hop'
downwards into the Si-Si bonds lying along <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">.  Next
the outer two O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms perform standard `hops' to replace the
original core atoms.  The two O atoms now lying along <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;next
hop outwards, and finally the two atoms remaining on <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;perform
a `coupled hop' downwards to adopt the new core sites along
<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">.  If these `coupled hops' in total take the same
time as a standard O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> hop this would match experiment.
<P>
Earlier experiments showed that TD concentration decreased near the
sample surface, with rates consistent with oxygen diffusion that was
enhanced by around four orders of magnitude[<A
 HREF="node149.html#gaworzewski_81">139</A>].
From this it is expected that the out-diffusion should increase with
[O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>], but it was found that the depth of depleted material
decreases with increasing O concentration[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hahn_86">260</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#tokuda_93">261</A>].
This is consistent with increasing oxygen concentration leading to
more dimers, which have thus a higher chance of being trapped by a
second dimer to form a thermal donor before out-gassing.  Thus this
result supports a thermal donor model consisting of the binding of two
or more oxygen dimers.
<P>
The reconstructed Si-Si bond is interesting.  Since it is quite
dilated it could potentially absorb a lot of the surrounding lattice
strain.  In this case oxygen dimers might sit in bond sites near to
the top of the defect so that their lattice strain is absorbed in this
way.  This is discussed further below with relation to higher order
TDs.  Such dimers would be able to rapidly respond to applied stress
if the defect core reoriented.
<P>
Results of Hallberg showed an initial 1.2&nbsp;eV formation rate for the
TDs that rapidly reverted to the standard 1.7&nbsp;eV[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>].
If the 1006&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> mode does correspond to the trimer, then
as-grown material contains an initial pool of trimers, and this 1.2&nbsp;eV
could correspond to the migration barrier for the trimer to travel to
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> in order to form the di-y-lid thermal donor.  Once this pool is
exhausted, the dimer migration barrier then becomes the rate limiting
step.  This is discussed further below.
<P>
Carbon passivation of thermal donors may occur by C substitution into
the core of this instead of the central Si atom, forming C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB>
which would be inactive.  This would either form by C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB> trapping
dimers initially, or else through C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> migrating to a TD and kicking
out the core Si atom to replace it.  This could go on to kick out a
further C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB> atom elsewhere and so the process is catalysed and only
requires a small number of Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms to start it off.
<P>
Note that this discussion does not address the question of whether
this structure represents TD2 or TD3, which is discussed further
below.
