2/3D thermal donors</A>

<P>
An alternative model for higher order thermal donors is a more general
aggregation of oxygen to a common TD core.  In this case dimers are
attracted to the core but bond into a variety of bond centred sites
around the core including, but not limited to, those along the
<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;defect plane.  Although the defect core causes compression
along <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">100<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;, there are Si-Si bond sites at angles to this which
are dilated due to at least one of the Si atoms being pushed off-site
by the strain field of the TD core, and these sites would provide
locations for dimer attack.  When discussing the mechanism in this
general way it is impossible to predict whether the process would be
serial, or whether several sites would have equivilent energies,
leading to isomeric thermal donors.  In a similar way to the
calculations shown in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node145.html#tab:tail_iso">9.8</A>, if the TD has six
sites surrounding it, four of which lie off the C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> mirror planes
and are symmetrically equivilent, and the other two lie on a mirror
plane and are a symmetric pair, there are 18 different permutations
obtainable by filling between 0 and 4 of these sites.  Hence only four
dimers are required to aggregate to the TD core to produce the
complete set of observed TDs, if TD isomers are allowed.
<P>
However, it appears that any perturbations of the thermal donor core
are only extremely small, and directly bonding dimers to the sides of
the core might be expected to perturb it to a larger degree.
In addition, ENDOR results suggest all oxygen lies along the <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;
plane, and O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> aggregates bonded to the defect core would be
expected to provide an ENDOR signal.
<P>
An alternative model, and one which seems consistent with experimental
data, is one whereby such sites exist much further from the defect
core.  In this case they are regions of the lattice arranged around
the core which exhibit some Si-Si bond dilation, and hence provide
weak binding sites for dimers.  These adopt these sites, forming a
`cloud' of dimers around the core like flies.  Thus they would only be
expected to weakly perturb the core structure and states.  Such sites
can be seen in our cluster results; although the bonds directly along
<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">001<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;are compressed, those to one side of these show some
dilation as the Si atoms directly above the defect core are pushed
upwards and away from their neighbours further off this plane.
<P>
The thermal donors would be expected to show extremely similar
behaviour under this picture with only slight variations from one
another.  For example, in the reorientation experiments discussed
above the core would still rotate as before, with the dimers just
shifting position to the new slightly tensile sites.  This would be
consistent with the ENDOR result since the O atoms would only be
weakly bound and not very close to the core, and hence would not show
up as part of the core structure.  Hence although the total defect
could display low symmetry, ENDOR and EPR would only measure the
C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> symmetry of the defect core.  Oxygen atoms in neighbouring
dilated sites may be responsible for the broad 1060&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> peak
observed after anneals, the broadness of the peak explained by the
slight variety in local environment of each of the atoms.
<P>
If trimers can occupy these sites it provides an additional variable
when determining the number of dimers/trimers needed to give the
required number of structural permutations to explain all of the
observed TDs, <I>i.e.</I>  less dimer sites would be required to
explain all of the TDs.  For an average of 10 O atoms per thermal
donor, this requires (with a core of 4 atoms) an average of either two
trimers or three dimers per thermal donor, which is a very modest
figure.
<P>
In this picture then, there is a dynamic equilibrium concentration of
dimers, and eventually trimers, adopting sites around the TDs.  The
position of the donor level in the gap should gradually increase as
the surrounding lattice strain goes up with dimer addition.  There is
essentially no perturbation of the core and instead an increasing
strain of the surrounding lattice, which compresses the <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$\langle$">001<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;
conduction band valleys used to construct the EMT-like donor state,
making it increasingly shallow.  If this was not the case we would
expect a spectrum of vibrational absorption peaks from TDs with
slightly perturbed cores, whereas in long time anneals there are only
four peaks in the 999-1020&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> range associated with electrical
activity [<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>]: the 999-TD3 band, the 1006 and
1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> electrically active bands, and a later 1015&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>
band, with the latter three thought to be associated with shallow
thermal donors.
<P>
A further key piece of evidence for such a picture is that the figure
of on average 10 atoms lost from solution per TD appears to be
independant of annealing temperature or time [<A
 HREF="node149.html#goesele_NATO">274</A>].
This suggests that TDs form rapidly, and then higher order TDs become
either more unstable or unable to trap further atoms.  This would be
consistent with a result where around 10-14 O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms could bind to
the TD with cumulative loss of energy, but thereafter there was an
energy increase[<A
 HREF="node149.html#goesele_NATO">274</A>].  This is consistent with this
`cloud' picture, where further dimers have to attach further from the
defect core and are increasingly weakly bound, until the higher order
TDs are in a thermal equilibrium with dimers sticking and releasing at
regular intervals.
<P>
Such a picture would also be consistent with a revised dimer model
where O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms sat on opposite sides of the hexagonal ring site.
