EPR and ENDOR</A>
</H2>
<P>
The results of EPR and ENDOR concerning thermal donors are well
summarised in [<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_NATO">10</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#spaeth_NATO">231</A>].  Relatively high TD
concentration is required which corresponds to quite long sample
anneal times, and hence EPR and ENDOR has only ever been applied to
the thermal donors TD<IMG WIDTH="68" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img315.gif"
 ALT="$n, n \geq 3$">, since TD1 and TD2 anneal out
before the experiments are performed [<A
 HREF="node149.html#michel_89">232</A>].
<P>
EPR detects two different types of heat treatment centre in Si, NL8
and NL10 [<A
 HREF="node149.html#gregorkiewicz_87">233</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#muller_78">204</A>].  These have since been
identified as the singly positive charge states of the thermal donors
and shallow thermal donors respectively.  The symmetry of these was
shown to be orthorhombic-I, or C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB>, with possible small
deviations [<A
 HREF="node149.html#gregorkiewicz_90">207</A>].  Thus they have two perpendicular (110)
mirror planes and a twofold axis
<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">100<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node149.html#sieverts_83">234</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#muller_78">204</A>].  Longer anneals showed a shift
in the <I>g</I>-tensor, indicating the gradual change from earlier TDs to
later species in the family.  The anisotropy of the <I>g</I>-tensor
suggested the NL8 defects were shallow, but not as shallow as the NL10
centres.  No hyperfine splitting of the spectrum was observed with
<SUP>17</SUP>O, since the hyperfine interaction is below the detection limit
of EPR [<A
 HREF="node149.html#gregorkiewicz_87b">210</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#michel_88">235</A>].
<P>
ENDOR showed <I>s</I>-type character to the donor wavefunction, indicative
of a shallow EMT donor [<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_NATO">10</A>].  Only super-hyperfine
interactions (shf) with Si and O were observed, suggesting that no
other impurities are involved in the centres.  It failed to detect a
single Si atom with prominent spin localisation, suggesting that the
donor activity does not originate from a single Si atom
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_NATO">10</A>].  Examination of the <SUP>17</SUP>O shf interaction
showed the O lies in a (110) plane [<A
 HREF="node149.html#michel_88">235</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#michel_89">232</A>].  No
evidence of an electrically active core was found, including no signal
corresponding to oxygen lying on the C<SUB>2</SUB> axis.  Notably ENDOR did
not detect a change in the number of oxygen atoms in the different TD
centres, in contradiction with other techniques such as FTIR
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_NATO">10</A>].  However the number of <SUP>17</SUP>O signals increases
with long anneal time, suggesting oxygen addition [<A
 HREF="node149.html#spaeth_NATO">231</A>],
and analysis of the growth in <SUP>29</SUP>Si and <SUP>17</SUP>O signals with time
shows an over-proportional increase in <SUP>17</SUP>O signal, <I>i.e.</I> the
amount of oxygen per thermal donor seems to be increasing with anneal
time.  The TDs which anneal out earlier have deeper donor states as
can be seen by their <SUP>29</SUP>Si shf interaction [<A
 HREF="node149.html#spaeth_NATO">231</A>],
<I>i.e.</I> the later TDs in the series have increasingly shallow
levels.  There were two shells of oxygen nuclei observed
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#michel_89">232</A>].  Thus, since the defect possesses C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> symmetry
it was assumed this translated into four oxygen atoms
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#michel_89">232</A>].  ENDOR also shows that each TD has only one Si atom
on the C<SUB>2</SUB> axis[<A
 HREF="node149.html#spaeth_NATO">231</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#michel_89">232</A>].
<P>
So to summarise, EPR and ENDOR provide a great deal of information
about the core structure of the thermal donor.  It must have C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB>
symmetry, contain only O and Si, with all O lying in the <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;
plane.  It can only have one Si atom on the C<SUB>2</SUB> axis (which cannot
be the sole source of defect activity) and no oxygen atoms.  The core
O atoms then lie in two distinct shells, and coupled with the planar
constraint on oxygen that implies at least four oxygen atoms in the
core.  The addition of further oxygen atoms must not change the core
signal, however ENDOR predicts the addition of oxygen to TDs with
annealing, leading to increasingly shallow levels.
