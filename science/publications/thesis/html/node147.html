Later TDs - Summary and Conclusion</A>
</H2>
<P>
We propose that a scheme consistent with the available experimental
evidence for later thermal donors is one whereby all the later TDs
contain a common thermal donor core which is not modified in the later
species.  Instead they could develop through nearby weak dimer binding
to the core, forming a `cloud' of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> around the donor core.  This
binding will be increasingly weak with increasing defect size, and
these atoms will not significantly perturb the core.  Thus there will
be a common set of vibrational modes as observed, and any symmetry
idenfication will only measure the C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> symmetry of the core.  The
defect levels will become increasingly shallow as these aggregate
atoms gradually increase the stress exerted on the defect core.  This
model is also consistent with the rapid observed reorientation under
stress.
<P>
Such a picture does not attempt to tackle the final stages of TD
formation.  After <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

999&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> thermal donor vibrational absorption drops
away[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>], while three new bands appear at 1006, 1012
and 1015&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.  It seems likely that this stage represents the
thermal donors finally transforming into quartz precipitates, with
these new bands being associated with other electrically active defect
complexes that form at this point, possibly shallow thermal donors.
In addition once quartz precipitates form there are other `new donors'
formed, possibly associated with the quartz boundaries[<A
 HREF="node149.html#pensl_89">275</A>].
<P>
There are other explanations for these higher order modes, apart from
shallow thermal donors vibrations.  They could be caused by dimer /
trimer trapping near to the quartz.  Alternatively if quartz
precipitates are being produced in these regimes, the associated
lattice strain punches out prismatic dislocation loops in the Si.
These dislocations can be pinned by O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, and so it seems reasonable
they may also be pinned by dimers and trimers.  Hence these broadened
modes could be associated with dimers and trimers pinned at
dislocations, the electrical activity coming from the dislocations
themselves.
<P>
The best that theory can do at this stage is to propose various
models, as has been done above, and therefore suggest discriminatory
experiments to select between them.  We are involved in on-going
discussions with several experimental groups on this subject
(Lindstr&#246;m and Hallberg, McQuaid, Newman and Markevich amongst
others), and hope to be able to reach some firmer conclusions soon.
