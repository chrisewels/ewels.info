Gaussian orbitals</A>
</H2>
<P>
Gaussian orbitals have the advantage that most integrals involving
them can be evaluated analytically.  They are a relatively localised
basis set that are ideally suited to modelling rapidly varying
functions such as wavefunction tail-off away from atomic cores such as
oxygen.  In this case the basis can easily be increased in the regions
of a cluster where it is needed, whereas plane wave methods have to
increase the plane waves throughout the supercell to achieve the same
effect.  However they do not individually approximate solutions to the
Kohn-Sham equations in the same way as Slater orbitals.  In addition,
increasing the number of Gaussian orbitals used to fit the orbitals
can quickly lead to <I>`over-completeness'</I>.  In this case the system
has functions which are very close with high overlaps, and can
generate unphysical eigenvalues as a result.
<P>
States that are highly delocalised in space, for example weak bonding
between distant molecular species, or fragments far from a surface,
can suffer from the use of Gaussian orbitals, since they are by their
nature localised.  However they work well in large molecular clusters
where often only a surprisingly small basis is required to accurately
model the structure.  Using fixed electronic charge means that it is
impossible for a system to spontaneously lose or gain electrons.  For
example, O<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>-</SUP> has a single very weakly bound electron that is
distributed over a large space; this delocalisation is not correctly
modelled by AIMPRO and the preference of the system to lose the
electron is manifested in positive occupied eigenvalues.
