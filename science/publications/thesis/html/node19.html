Pseudopotentials</A>

DFT as described above would still prove computationally too difficult
for system sizes useful for point defect modelling.  It is therefore
necessary to simplify the system further, and one important way of
achieving this is through the use of pseudopotentials.  These rely on
the fact that the core electrons sit tightly bound to their host
nuclei, and only the valence electrons are involved in chemical
bonding.  Therefore it is possible to incorporate the core states into
a bulk nuclear potential, or pseudo-potential, and only deal with the
valence electrons separately.
<P>
Core wavefunctions are rapidly varying with many nodes, and require a
large number of fitting functions to model accurately;
pseudopotentials overcome this as the pseudo-wavefunction is smoothly
varying and nodeless within a certain core radius.  In addition the
Coulombic interaction of core states would tend to swamp any total
energy calculations trying to compare small differences in valence
bond energies.  In order to remain orthogonal to the core states, the
valence states are also forced to become rapidly oscillating near the
atomic core, requiring large numbers of fitting functions to model
accurately.  Pseudopotentials overcome all of these problems.  They
become particularly important for the heavier elements when the number
of core electrons vastly outweighs the valence electrons.  Finally for
heavier atoms in which relativistic effects are important, and so the
Dirac equation is required, the valence electrons can be treated
non-relativistically. Therefore removal of the core electrons allows a
non-relativistic approach to be maintained (some corrections are
required in the core electron pseudopotentials to account for
relativistic effects, see below).
<P>
Pseudopotentials assume that the localised core states do not take
part in bonding, and so can be incorporated as a change in the charge
state of the nucleus.  Between the nucleus and some cut-off radius
<I>r</I><SUB><I>c</I></SUB>, the all-electron valence wavefunctions can be replaced with a
smoothed form; beyond this radius the pseudo-wavefunction must be
identical to the full all-electron wavefunction.  In addition there
will still be exchange interactions between core and valence electrons
which must be included in the potentials.  Finally, if
self-consistency is to be easily achieved in the calculations then the
potentials must have the correct atomic charge density outside the
core (<I>`norm-conserving'</I> pseudo-potentials).
<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node19.html#fig:ni_pot">2.2</A> shows the radial 4<I>s</I> full- and pseudo-
wavefunction for Ni.  It can be seen that the rapidly varying core
region has been smoothed in the pseudo-wavefunction but beyond the
cut-off radius, <I>r</I><SUB><I>c</I></SUB>, the pseudo- and all-electron- wavefunctions are
identical.

The pseudopotentials used in AIMPRO come from work done by Bachelet,
Hamann and Schl&#252;ter [<A
 HREF="node149.html#bhs">23</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#bhs_prl">26</A>] who produced pseudopotentials
for all elements up to Pu.  There are four fundamental properties
which these pseudo-potentials display:
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Real and pseudo- valence eigenvalues agree for a chosen
``prototype'' atomic configuration.
<DT>2.
<DD>Real and pseudo- atomic wave functions agree beyond <I>r</I><SUB><I>c</I></SUB>, a
      chosen ``core radius''.
<DT>3.
<DD>The integrals from 0 to <I>r</I> of the real and pseudo charge
      densities agree for <I>r</I> &gt; <I>r</I><SUB><I>c</I></SUB> for each valence state (norm
      conservation).
<DT>4.
<DD>The logarithmic derivatives of the real and pseudo wave function
      and their first energy derivatives agree for <I>r</I> &gt; <I>r</I><SUB><I>c</I></SUB>.
</DL>
<P>
The last two points are essential if the pseudopotential is to have
optimum transferability.
