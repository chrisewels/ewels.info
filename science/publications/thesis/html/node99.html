The shallow thermal donors (STDs) are a family of defects which can be
formed by annealing N rich Cz-Si around 650<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#abe_85">184</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#stein_86b">185</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#navarro_86">186</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#suezawa_86">187</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#suezawa_88">165</A>].  As single donors
they have ionisation energies from 0.0347 to 0.0374 eV
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#griffin_86b">188</A>]; this is comparable with P, and is much shallower
than the thermal double donor (TD) (0.0530 to 0.0693 eV).  N is known
to suppress TD formation [<A
 HREF="node149.html#yang_95">189</A>].
<P>
EPR experiments of Hara <I>et. al.</I>  [<A
 HREF="node149.html#hara_89">190</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#hara_90">191</A>] found STD
defects to have <I>S</I>=1/2 with a <I>g</I>-tensor extremely close to that of
the NL10 defect. This led them to suggest that they were the same
defect. The <I>g</I>-tensor shows that the STD possesses an apparent
<I>C</I><SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> symmetry.  However EPR and ENDOR studies have failed to
resolve any hyperfine splitting in the defect core
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hara_89">190</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_95">192</A>] and so the presence of N in the defect is
only inferred from its presence in the material and remains
controversial.  Although several studies claim to have shown that both
O and N must be present in the Si for STDs to form
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#yang_95">189</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#hara_89">190</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#suezawa_88">165</A>], other workers [<A
 HREF="node149.html#liesert_93">168</A>] find
STDs in nominally N free Cz-Si.  In addition, large N concentrations
can actually <I>suppress</I> STD formation [<A
 HREF="node149.html#griffin_89">193</A>]. We
believe that the explanation of these conflicting observations lies in
a) that other defects, not containing N, can be STDs, and b) there are
other electrically inactive nitrogen-oxygen defects which form in
competition with the N-related STDs (see Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node92.html#nno">7.4</A>).
<P>
The IR electronic absorption lines observed by Suezawa <I>et. al.</I>
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#suezawa_88">165</A>] originated from several different families of STDs.
In addition, calculations using effective mass theory by Griffin <I>
et. al.</I>  [<A
 HREF="node149.html#griffin_86b">188</A>] suggest that the different families of STDs
are due to different numbers of oxygen atoms surrounding a common core,
with larger oxygen complexes leading to increasingly shallow donor
behaviour.
<P>
Recently, Yang <I>et. al.</I> annealed N-doped Si containing STDs
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#yang_95">189</A>].  As their concentration decreased, the concentrations of
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and N-pairs, as monitored by IR spectroscopy, increased.
Conversely when STDs formed, the concentration of both O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and
N-pairs decreased. This unfortunately cannot be taken as direct
evidence that these elements are part of the STD, because it is known
that electrically inactive NNO defects can be formed around the same
temperature as STDs [<A
 HREF="node149.html#jones_94c">103</A>] (Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node92.html#nno">7.4</A>), and this confuses
the issue.  It seems to us that while N pairs would complex with O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
creating inactive NNO defects [<A
 HREF="node149.html#rasmussen_NATO">177</A>], N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
defects could form active centres.
<P>
Liesert <I>et. al.</I> [<A
 HREF="node149.html#liesert_93">168</A>] observed PL from STDs in
samples that were nominally N-free.  It may be that there was an
undetected level of N in these materials but it is worth considering
whether STDs can be formed with different core centres.  One such
possibility to be considered below is an oxygen complex with C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>-H.
The latter defect is to be distinguished from the marginally stable
substitutional carbon - hydrogen defect [<A
 HREF="node149.html#endros_89">194</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#endros_91">195</A>].  A
C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>H defect complexed with a substitutional carbon atom 
forms the T-centre [<A
 HREF="node149.html#safonov_96">196</A>] which is observed when Cz-Si
containing carbon is annealed between 450<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C and 600<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#minaev_81">197</A>].  There is no deliberate H doping of these materials
showing that H is a common and unintentional impurity in Cz-Si
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#safonov_94">198</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#lightowlers_94">199</A>].  The chemistry of C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>H seems very
similar to that of N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and hence it is plausible that (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>n</I></SUB>
defects could form in C, O and H rich Si.
<P>
Recent work has shown that there does indeed exist a family of STDs
that contain hydrogen, since there is a shift in the electronic
infra-red resonances associated with the <IMG WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img298.gif"
 ALT="$1s \rightarrow 2p_\pm$">transitions of the STD when hydrogen is replaced with deuterium
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_95">192</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#newman_96">200</A>].  This shift is not reproduced in the
thermal donor resonances.  This work correlates IR absorption
strengths of these STDs to EPR spin concentration of the NL10
spectrum, suggesting they are the same defect.  However there are at
least two different sources of NL10 containing either H or Al
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_95">192</A>], and these results do not explain the nitrogen
containing samples.  This therefore suggests there are at least three
types of STD, one N-based, one containing H, and one containing Al.
It is suggested that the H-based STDs could be H-passivated TDs
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_95">192</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#newman_96">200</A>]. However the H-related STDs are stable up
to 520<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C [<A
 HREF="node149.html#ron_private">201</A>], whereas TDs have broken down by
then.  In addition, H passivated TDs have been identified and are
known to lose hydrogen and reactivate at less than 200<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#weber_94">202</A>,<A

<P>
The NL10 centres were originally observed by M&#252;ller <I>et al</I>
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#muller_78">204</A>].  These are electron spin resonance (ESR) active centres
with <I>C</I><SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> symmetry after annealing from 450 to 600&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C.  The
<I>g</I> tensor of Si-NL10 is less anisotropic than that of NL8 (TD<SUP>+</SUP>),
suggesting its paramagnetic electron is only weakly bound, consistent
with a shallow donor state, and it has spin <IMG WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img299.gif"
 ALT="$S=\frac{1}{2}$">[<A
 HREF="node149.html#martynov_95">11</A>].  NL10 defects have a series-like character

 HREF="node149.html#gregorkiewicz_90">207</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#gregorkiewicz_92">208</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#gregorkiewicz_92b">209</A>], and ENDOR work shows
they include oxygen within one {011} lattice plane forming a planar
structure[<A
 HREF="node149.html#gregorkiewicz_87">233</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#gregorkiewicz_88">205</A>].  In addition, ENDOR
suggests NL10 is structurally similar to NL8 (associated with the
thermal donors), with an identical oxygen structure
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_95">192</A>].  Therefore identification of NL10 could give
important clues as to the structure of the thermal donors.
