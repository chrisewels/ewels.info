Previous theoretical models</A>
</H2>
<P>
There have been several thermal donor models proposed in the past,
notably the O<SUB>2</SUB>Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> model [<A
 HREF="node149.html#deak_92">105</A>], the O<SUB>3<I>i</I></SUB> model
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#stavola_83b">249</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#chadi_96">211</A>], and the OBS model [<A
 HREF="node149.html#ourmazd_84">250</A>].
<P>
As the initial concentration of TDs was proportional to [O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>]<SUP>4</SUP>,
initial models concentrated on defects containing four O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms.
Kaiser <I>et al</I> proposed a SiO<SUB>4</SUB> tetrahedral structure
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#kaiser_58">179</A>].  This was believed to become inactive on addition of a
fifth O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, and the model was abandoned when it was discovered that
there was a whole family of TDs.
<P>
Later work concentrated on trivalent oxygen in different complexes.
The strongest contender here is O<SUB>3<I>i</I></SUB> with the central O atom in a
`y-lid' trivalent structure (see Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node133.html#fig:3O">9.13</A>).  This was
originally proposed in 1983&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node149.html#stavola_83b">249</A>], and has been modelled
by several groups since&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node149.html#saito_88">93</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#saito_89">251</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#chadi_96">211</A>].  Since this
model features O on the C<SUB>2</SUB> axis it cannot account for TD3 or higher
(ENDOR shows no O on the C<SUB>2</SUB> axis), however it could be TD1 or TD2.
This was shown using first principle supercell methods to be 0.7&nbsp;eV
lower in energy than three neighbouring BC O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node149.html#chadi_96">211</A>].
This structure was also proposed as a core with two further flanking
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms, forming a 5O species [<A
 HREF="node149.html#snyder_84">28</A>] (see
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node128.html#fig:5O_core">9.11</A>).  The central O atom becomes trivalent in
response to the compression from the other oxygen atoms, and is the
source of the electrical activity.  However ENDOR excludes this as a
model for TD3+ for the same reasons as the 3O `y-lid' species.

<P>
To avoid the problem of O on the C<SUB>2</SUB> axis, a di-y-lid model was
proposed by two groups [<A
 HREF="node149.html#jones_90">111</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#snyder_89b">252</A>] (see
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node124.html#fig:4O_core">9.4</A>), and later work suggested that the `y-lid'
trivalent structure discussed above could transform into this with the
addition of further O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms [<A
 HREF="node149.html#chadi_96">211</A>].  CNDO/S calculations
found this to be 1.5&nbsp;eV unstable with respect to another alternative
4O species, the di-oxy-square [<A
 HREF="node149.html#deak_92">105</A>] (see
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node122.html#fig:dioxy_square">9.1</A>), consisting of four trivalent oxygen
atoms in two neighbouring squares.  This model was also discarded
since the donor wavefunction is concentrated on the square structures
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#snyder_89b">252</A>] in disagreement with that deduced by ENDOR.  The
di-ylid consisting of two oxygen atoms in y-lid configurations without
the flanking O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms was modelled, but this is extremely tensile
and unstable with respect to other configurations such as the BC dimer
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#deak_92">105</A>].

<P>
Prior to the ENDOR result that all O lies on the same C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> plane
with no O on the C<SUB>2</SUB> axis, one of the more popular models was the
OSB model, shown schematically in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node122.html#fig:OSB">9.2</A> [<A
 HREF="node149.html#ourmazd_84">250</A>].
This assumes that oxygen aggregation and compression pushes a core
lattice Si off its site to become a divalent bridging Si atom, which
is the source of the donor activity.  The donor can then become
inactive through the ejection of this atom as an interstitial.  The
model is compressive along <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;and was abandoned in light of
the new ENDOR data.
<P>
The model that has received strong support in the last few years is
the De&#225;k model, shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node122.html#fig:deak">9.3</A>.  This consists of
two tri-valent oxygen atoms pinning a Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> between them which is
divalent&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node149.html#deak_91">253</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#deak_92">105</A>].  The electrical activity comes from
the trivalent O atoms, which donate electrons to the empty states on
the Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.

<P>
There are several reasons why the De&#225;k model cannot be correct.  One
problem comes through the bistability of the early TDs, TD1 and TD2,
which exhibit isomeric electrically inactive structures
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#latusho_86">254</A>].  There seems no easy way  of reconstructing the De&#225;k
model such that the Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> core atom can become fully coordinated.  It
is possible for several Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> to aggregate in such a way that all of
the dangling bonds combine, but not with a single atom.  Alternative
structures with trivalent Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> were proposed as the inactive forms,
since the CNDO calculations gave its dangling bond state in the
valence band&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node149.html#deak_91">253</A>].  However AIMPRO calculations of
trivalent Si give this state deep in the band gap
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#leary_unpublished">255</A>].  In addition, the vibrational mode agreement
of the model with experiment is poor.  The corrected calculated CNDO
modes lie at 984 and 901&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>, when calculated with AIMPRO we get
modes at 823.5 and 805.4&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.  Experimental modes for TD3 are
observed at 999 and 728&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> so the agreement is poor.  There are
other subtleties, for example ENDOR shows only a single Si atom on the
C<SUB>2</SUB> axis whereas this model has two; this has been explained in
terms of low electron density on the Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>[<A
 HREF="node149.html#deak_private">256</A>].
<P>
In conjunction with this, Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> was proposed as the structure of
TD1 which would rapidly migrate and trap an additional O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  However
Newman points out that Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> has been observed and is only
stable to 50&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$^\circ$">C [<A
 HREF="node149.html#newman_94">257</A>], with a binding
energy of somewhere near 0.8&nbsp;eV.  Thus this is ruled out as a model
for TD1.
<P>
Various other models have been proposed over the years.  It was
suggested that an O<SUB>2</SUB> molecule in a vacancy might have double donor
character if its antibonding p<IMG WIDTH="21" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

gap[<A

density Greens function calculations of Kelly[<A
