<P>
I would like to thank both Exeter Physics Department and the EPSRC for
providing resources and funding for my research assistantship
throughout this PhD.
<P>
There are many people to thank for their support and encouragement,
without whom this thesis would not have been possible.
<P>
Firstly my supervisor, Dr. Bob Jones, whose enthusiastic cry of `Any
Progress' will haunt me for the rest of my days - his unquenchable
curiosity and love for the subject are probably the most valuable
lessons I have learned from this PhD, and his continual support and
encouragement have kept me going over the last three or so years.
<P>
Thanks also to Malcolm for my brief stay in Sussex, and all the other
AIMPRO group members, particularly Jon Goss for loaning me `Burn the
World' and putting me off Roy Harper for life and Paul Leary for his
`Spudman' caricatures.  Also Antonio, Ben, Bernd, Sven, Chris, Steve,
John, Joachim, Gerd and others - I hope I'll see you all down at the
New Inn some time!  Also to the many collaborators I've worked with,
particularly Jo Miro, Tomas Hallberg, Frank Berg Rasmussen, Brian Bech
Nielsen, Bernard Pajot and Peter De&#225;k, whose suggestions and/or
guidance around their local pubs was always much appreciated.
<P>
Next there's all the friends I've made, the list is too long to
mention but their friendship, drinking or dancing skills helped to
make my stay in Exeter a really happy one, and hopefully I'll be able
to make use of their floorspace from time to time in years to come.
Thanks also to Julia for some great times and a close race to
finishing our theses, one bet that I may have just won!
<P>
Finally my family, who have been great over the years and never raised
an eyebrow when I claimed my thesis would be finished in the `next two
weeks' for nearly a year...
<P>

Think no more, lad; laugh, be jolly: <BR>
Why should men make haste to die? <BR>
Empty heads and tongues a-talking <BR>
Make the rough road easy walking, <BR>
And the feather pate of folly <BR>
Bears the falling sky.
<P><P>

<P>
Oh, 'tis jesting, dancing, drinking <BR>
Spins the heavy world around. <BR>
If young hearts were not so clever, <BR>
Oh, they would be young for ever: <BR>
Think no more; 'tis only thinking <BR>
Lays lads underground.
