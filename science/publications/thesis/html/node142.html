General discussion of early stages of TD formation</A>

<P>
There are also other possibilities beyond those considered above.
One of these is that the dimer can structurally transform into TD1/2.
This is unlikely since it would require four distinct structures for
an oxygen pair; the dimer, TD1 and TD2, and the electrically inactive
form of TD1/2.  In addition, such a model also suffers from the lack
of direct correlation between [TD1/2] and the 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> dimer
absorption.  We have not been able to determine any electrically
active double donor structures for the dimer (although structures such
as a di-y-lid core could theoretically be produced by only two O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
atoms, the resultant lattice strain would be huge).
<P>
It has also been suggested that trimers do not form [<A
 HREF="node149.html#mcquaid_95">143</A>],
but the models discussed here all assume they are at least marginally
stable.  If trimers do not form, it is difficult to explain the
1006&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> LVM.  However rather than being a stable defect
complex, it is possible the trimer is simple the result of a dimer
pushing O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> along for a few steps before moving on separately again.
<P>
There are many other ways these arguments may break down, not least
that some of the experimental evidence may be misleading; for example
the isomeric nature of TD1 and TD2 could actually just be due to very
similar inactive forms that vibrate at the same frequencies.
<P>
It has been stated at above that it is impossible to generate a
C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> structure with an odd number of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms without putting
an oxygen on the C<SUB>2</SUB> axis.  To further complicate matters it may be
possible to have a structure such as the Snyder-Stavola model where a
single oxygen atom lies off the C<SUB>2</SUB> axis, but has a tiny barrier to
the symmetrically mirrored structure with the oxygen on the other side
of the axis.  In this case the structure would in practise flip
rapidly between the two structures and would obtain time averaged
C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> symmetry, have an odd number of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, and yet might not show
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> on the actual C<SUB>2</SUB> axis.
<P>
Unfortunately without the ability to accurately compare energies
between these different structures there is little more that theory
can do for the thermal donor problem at this point, beyond proposing a
variety of models, and eliminating those that it can on the basis of
the available experimental evidence.  The variability in oxygen
energies does not appear to be just a problem with AIMPRO but of many
DFT codes; Chadi finds that addition of O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> to OV is endothermic in
contradiction with experiment [<A
 HREF="node149.html#chadi_NATO">95</A>], and work by
Pantelides <I>et al</I> on the O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> diffusion barrier has varied
between 1.8&nbsp;eV and 2.5&nbsp;eV in recent papers[<A
 HREF="node149.html#needels_91">115</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#ramamoorthy_96">130</A>].
<P>
This work proposes many models that seem to be suitable as either TD1,
TD2 or TD3.  The di-y-lid structure fits TD3 very well in terms of
structure, electronic properties, and vibrational modes.  Other
structures we cannot eliminate include the Snyder-Stavola, a new 4O
`flanked square' structure, and even the partially dissociated trimer
structure given above.  However all of these three would appear to be
models for only TD1 and possibly TD2 for the Snyder-Stavola, on
symmetry grounds.  It is definitely the case that there are a variety
of possible models with shallow double donor character that only
require trivalent O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, BC O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and lattice Si, and do not need to
invoke Si self-interstitials.
