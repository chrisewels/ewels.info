This was modelled using a 151 atom cluster in the +1 charge state,
CSi<SUB>79</SUB>H<SUB>69</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node108.html#fig:cho2_c2v">8.6</A>).  The presence of
the (C-H) bond gives the defect <I>C</I><SUB>1<I>h</I></SUB> symmetry rather than
<I>C</I><SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB>.  However, more recent ENDOR symmetry analysis
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_NATO">10</A>] has shown that NL10(H), the EPR/ENDOR signal
associated with H-related shallow thermal donors (see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node109.html#sec:nl10">8.7</A>) was misassigned using EPR to C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB>
symmetry.  Using ENDOR they have shown it to be triclinic, with H
lying along [110] perpendicular to the plane containing O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, in
agreement with this model.

The O forms assymetric bonds of 1.66 and 1.62&nbsp;&#197;, the shorter bond
with the more positive Si atom shared with the (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  The Si-O-Si
bond angle is 158<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">.  C forms three strong Si bonds, the top two
of 1.818&nbsp;&#197; and the bond with the core Si of 1.905&nbsp;&#197;.  The C-H
unit has a short C-H bond of 1.115&nbsp;&#197;, and C moves out of plane by
0.159&nbsp;&#197;.  However, unlike N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB>, this defect was not
itself a shallow donor, the level instead lying closer to mid-gap.
Changing the charge state of the defect to neutral or -1 through the
addition of 1 or 2 electrons respectively, had little effect on the
structure, and the level remained deep in the gap.  In this case the
empty dangling bond on the Si was either singly (neutral) or doubly
(-1 charged) occupied.  The C-H bond dilated (1.138&nbsp;&#197; when
neutral, 1.145&nbsp;&#197; when -1), and the distance between the C and the
core Si increased (1.965&nbsp;&#197; when neutral, 2.001&nbsp;&#197; when -1).
The O atoms were also pushed back into their bond centres (Si-O-Si
bond angles of 173<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">), and all of these shifts are consistent
with increased charge in the defect core.  These results show that, by
itself, the (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> defect in this configuration is not a
single shallow donor.  We deliberately breached the defect symmetry
after relaxation but in all cases it returned to the symmetric
structures described above with the same energies.

We next examined the stability of this defect and found it to be less
stable than the alternative structure with both oxygen atoms on the
same side of the C (similar to its unhydrogenated cousin,
C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>-O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB>, responsible for the `P-line' PL absorption).  This
lop-sided defect structure is 1.36&nbsp;eV more stable than the symmetric
one in the neutral charge state (1.33 and 1.76&nbsp;eV in the +1 and -1
charge states respectively).  This also has a deep donor level rather
than a shallow one.  The structure is shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node108.html#fig:cho2_alt">8.7</A>.  We again examined the three possible
charge states of this defect, +1, 0, or -1, corresponding to different
populations of the Si <I>p</I>-type dangling bond in the core of the
defect.  In the +1 charge state the core Si stayed close to the
<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">001<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;axis, but in the neutral and -1 charge state it bows away
from the neighbouring oxygen atom, allowing it to localise the filled
<I>p</I>-type orbital as far from the oxygen lone-pairs as possible.  In
this respect its behaviour mimics that of N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, and presumably
the exact analogy, (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> would also behave in a similar way.
<P>
The lack of shallow donor properties for (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> in the
C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB> configuration is initially surprising, given that it is
iso-electronic with the N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> shallow thermal donor.  However
the (CH) unit is less electronegative than N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and so the core Si
atom is less polarised.  This in turn provides less driving force to
draw the oxygen atoms inwards and indirectly compress the gap level.
In addition the back-bonds of (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> are not as dilated as those of
N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, and so there is less strain energy to be gained from placing
the oxygen atoms next to the (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>; this is why the oxygen atoms
prefer to sit on one side where they gain energy through 
quadrapole interactions through their shared lattice Si.
<P>
However the <I>C</I><SUB>1<I>h</I></SUB> defect could still act as a <I>STD core</I>, and
would become stable with the addition of further oxygen atoms, similar
to N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>-O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB>.  This would also help to compress the defect core.
We therefore relaxed (C-H)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>-O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB>, and found that it possessed a
single shallow donor level.  The Kohn-Sham eigenvalues are shown in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node112.html#fig:evals_cho4">8.10</A>, showing the donor level.  (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB>
is examined further, below in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node110.html#popout">8.8</A>.
<P>
In conclusion, it appears that C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>HO<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB> is a stable shallow
donor defect, possesses <I>C</I><SUB>1<I>h</I></SUB> symmetry and contains a C-H bond
lying along [011]. There is very little spin-polarised density
residing on C or H.  The defect core, C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>HO<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> is more stable in
a C<SUB>1</SUB> configuration similar to C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB>.  In n-type material
the (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> defect would be either neutral or -1 charged.
