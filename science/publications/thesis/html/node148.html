<SMALL>Normally screws are so cheap and small and simple you
think of them as unimportant. But now, as your Quality awareness
becomes stronger, you realise that this one, individual, particular
screw is neither cheap nor small nor unimportant.  Right now this
screw is worth exactly the selling price of the whole motorcycle,
because the motorcycle is actually valueless until you get the screw
out.  With this re-evaluation of the screw comes a willingness to
expand your knowledge of it.</SMALL>

<P>
Although conclusions have been drawn at the end of each individual
chapter, it is useful to discuss some general conclusions here, as
well as further work that could stem from that presented in this
thesis.
<P>
The results for H in III-V materials has potential for expansion to
other members of the III-V family, notably GaN which shows great
potential as a wide bandgap semiconductor.  Such an investigation for
the Group II passivation is currently underway by Torres and &#214;berg
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#torres">276</A>], and preliminary results suggest a transition from BC to
AB hydrogen for various sized Group II impurity in GaN.  The advantage
of such work is the variety of different III-Vs and Group II
impurities which makes it possible to draw general trends depending on
host and impurity type.
<P>
There are many conclusions to be drawn from the O in Si work.  Our
successful collaboration with a variety of experimental groups has
shown the advantage of productive experimental/theoretical discussion.
Recent developments in computing power and parallelisation of the code
mean we can now tackle reasonably large defect systems such as the
(CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB> shallow thermal donor which would have been
impossible only a few years ago.  Theory is now equipped to take a
place as a serious investigative tool alongside conventional methods
such as FTIR and DLTS, and theoretical investigations can now help to
point experimental groups in directions for their
research<A NAME="tex2html110"
 HREF="footnode.html#10173"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A>.
<P>
The problem of oxygen in silicon is a tricky one, since oxygen seems
able to complex with most other impurities, both extrinsic and
intrinsic.  The difficulty is compounded for theory since many of the
defect structures formed are only metastable (for example, thermal
donors), and so absolute ground state energy comparison cannot
necessarily be used as a tool for determining the dominant defect
structures.
<P>
Formation energies with AIMPRO for O-related complexes have proved
difficult (such as VO<SUB><I>n</I></SUB> complexes), possibly due to inadequate
modelling of the charge density via our intermediate fits.  In future
we may be able to improve on this through the use of the new supercell
AIMPRO code under development in Newcastle, possibly in conjunction
with gradient corrections to the exchange-correlation energy.
Although many kinetic models for TD formation and destruction have
been proposed[<A
 HREF="node149.html#markevich_NATO">147</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#mcquaid_95">143</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#suezawa_NATO">277</A>], for these
to achieve the desired accuracy, formation energies of the individual
species need to be determined.  This has not been done to date.
Hopefully with the improvements to AIMPRO described above, coupled
with structural models for the various component species, we may be
able to achieve this.
<P>
Significant advances have been made in our understanding of O in Si as
a result of the work in this thesis.  The behaviour of O in the
presence of N has been well characterised, both through the primary
electrically inactive NNO defect, and the more elusive NO<SUB>2</SUB> shallow
thermal donor, as well as the intermediate N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> species which
for the first time shows direct evidence of interaction between N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
and oxygen rather than N<SUB>2</SUB>.  In future there will hopefully be
direct evidence for the incorporation of N in the shallow thermal
donor centres, and they may be produced in sufficient numbers for
clear identification through their vibrational modes.  Various N/O
experiments have been suggested here which would fill in the remaining
gaps in our understanding of how N<SUB>2</SUB> pairs diffuse, and complex with
either O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> or O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> dimers.
<P>
Crucially we have demonstrated a general mechanism whereby defects
that normally possess a deep gap level (such as N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>) can have this
level electrostatically compressed, pushing it up to become a shallow
level lying close to the conduction band edge.  It may be possible to
invoke a similar mechanism in other materials, possibly those where it
has traditionally been difficult to produce shallow donor doping.
We have shown that this mechanism can occur in defects containing both
N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, and although there is no direct experimental
evidence yet that N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> or (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> lie in the core of the shallow
thermal donor defects, we have presented a strong case in favour of
these models.
<P>
The results on rapidly diffusing O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> dimers appear to shed
light on many otherwise confusing results, such as the anomalous
formation rates of VO<SUB>2</SUB> and the thermal donors.  Their role in
thermal donor formation is now clearer, although there is still a long
way to go on this problem.
<P>
Finally the results on the thermal donors show a variety of different
O-based complexes which display shallow double donor character.  The
di-y-lid structure, formed from a combination of two dimers, seems to
fit most of the available symmetry and structural evidence, and
possesses vibrational modes very close to those of experiment.  A
variant of this with Al substituted for the core Si acts as a single
shallow donor and is also consistent with experimental data for the
third type of NL10 defect, NL10(Al).
<P>
We thus have a remarkably consistent set of structural predictions for
shallow donor defects in Cz-Si, all based around the combination of
two dimers.  The thermal donors form around a di-y-lid, which occurs
when two dimers combine.  When these two dimers aggregate at Al<SUB><I>s</I></SUB>,
N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> or (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, they form instead a shallow thermal donor defect.
Such a picture does not yet explain the whole family of thermal
donors, including the various anomalous properties of TD1, although
the work presented in this thesis goes a long way to selecting between
various models.
<P>
Long time annealing studies show that the shallow thermal donors form
after the thermal donors [<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_NATO">10</A>], which is consistent
with FTIR studies; these show the TD absorption at 999&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> drop
off at 450<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$"> after 150 hours or so, at the same time as strong
absorption at 1012, 1006 and 1015&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> begins.  These lines are
believed to be associated with the shallow thermal donors
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>].  Discussion in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node138.html#sec:si_i">9.7</A> suggests
that early Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> concentrations are low.  This leads to a consistent
picture whereby small initial Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> concentrations lead to low C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
and hence STD (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB> concentrations.  After long annealing
times thermal donors form, and then transform into quartz
precipitates, releasing Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  These convert the remaining C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB>
into C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, providing a sudden glut of (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB> defects.
Thereafter, any more Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> forming has to aggregate into <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$\langle$">311<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

rod-like aggregates, as seen with HREM[<A
 HREF="node149.html#takeda_92">278</A>].
<P>
For reasons of limited space, results on C/O defects such as
C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> and C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>ni</I></SUB> where 1&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 SRC="img241.gif"
 ALT="$\leq$">&nbsp;3 have
been excluded from this thesis, but this work is important and a
thorough study of C/O defects is essential in order to understand O in
Si.  C primarily exists as a substitutional defect (C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB>), but can
switch sites with a silicon self-interstitial (Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>) through a
`kick-out' mechanism to produce interstitial carbon (C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>).  Thus
[C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>] can be taken as an indirect marker of the Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
concentration.  P-line defects are observed using PL (believed to be
C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB>) within the first 15 minutes of annealing Cz-Si at
450<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C[<A
 HREF="node149.html#minaev_81">197</A>], suggesting that there is either an
initial pool of C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, or some initial Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  However the
concentration of these defects is extremely small, probably <IMG WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img339.gif"
 ALT="$\sim
10^{13}$"> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>[<A
 HREF="node149.html#ed_private">279</A>].  Annealing C rich CZ-Si gives
rise to a set of vibrational lines associated with C/O defect
complexes instead of thermal donors.  Due to the high frequency of the
C-modes it has been suggested that these are C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>ni</I></SUB> defects
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>], and if this was the case it would show that
Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> must be produced during early Cz-Si annealing.  However
preliminary modelling results with AIMPRO show that C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>ni</I></SUB>
defects produce vibrational modes close to these frequencies, and the
modes due to the C are high because the C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB> is compressed by
neighbouring oxygen.  In combination with the low initial
concentration of P-line defects, these results suggest that Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> is
<I>not</I> present in significant quantities in the earlier stages of
annealing, and thus provide more evidence that Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> does not lie in
the core of thermal donors.  In addition the role of C in suppressing
thermal donors is not fully understood (since C appears to increase
the rate of thermal donor dissociation rather than decreasing the rate
of formation).  Further studies of C/O defects are currently
underway[<A
 HREF="node149.html#leary_thesis">280</A>].
<P>
The work in this thesis has opened up a number of new questions (and
failed to answer others!) and many of these deserve further study.  As
well as modelling and/or explaining current experimental data we have
also attempted to make predictions, and there are some experiments it
would be useful to perform to examine these.  In addition there are
more general questions such as the mobility of N<SUB>2</SUB> pairs which could
be checked by experiment. Where such experiments suggest themselves,
these have been described in the text.  This following section is
therefore restricted to further theoretical modelling work that could
extend the results in this thesis.
<P>
It would be useful to produce a full potential surface map for dimer
diffusion to prove that we have located the lowest energy path between
the end structures.  If the assymetric dimer structure is freezing in
at low temperatures we could calculate a diffusion barrier between the
assymetric and symmetric forms and hence a temperature at which they
could no longer switch between the two.
<P>
The trimer requires more investigation of various alternative
structures in order to determine both the lowest energy, and a
structure that could give rise to the absorption at 1006&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.
The results presented here were performed in quite small clusters
given the size of the defects, and for reliability the convergence
with cluster size should be checked by repeating these in larger
clusters.  In addition, determination of binding energies and
potential diffusion paths for the trimer would be important to
calculate.
<P>
The thermal donor problem still has many unanswered questions that we
can address.  There are several other possible TD structures not
investigated here (notably the +2 variant of the `Manx' trimer), and
it would be useful to repeat many of these calculations using the
supercell to provide reliable energy differences between alternative
structures.  We are still unsure of the nature of TD1 and TD2, and are
far from a definitive explanation of higher order TDs.  Such analysis
could be helped through a detailed correlation of electronic IR with
vibrational IR absorption data showing the formation stages of the
TDs, and it is clear that this problem will not be solved without
extensive collaboration with experimental groups.
<P>
Notable related problems are the mechanism for H-passivation of
thermal donors, and carbon suppression of thermal donors, both of
which are currently under investigation using AIMPRO.  Neither of
these are obvious, for example, H-passivation seems to remove both
donor states from the gap with the addition of only a single H
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#jweber_NATO">203</A>],  suggesting the H is stabilising the TD in an
inactive form rather than saturating dangling bonds.
<P>
Clues to the aggregation processes in TDs could come from studying the
aggregation of O in higher order VO<SUB><I>n</I></SUB> complexes, <IMG WIDTH="49" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img340.gif"
 ALT="$n \geq 4$">, and
increased computational power means we now have the ability to do
this.  If we can increase the ease with which diffusion barriers are
obtained, it would be nice to model the migration barrier for other
species, notably N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and N<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB>.
<P>
Finally, there are many other atomic species that can complex with
oxygen which have not been addressed here.  A variety of
hydrogen-oxygen complexes are known to form [<A
 HREF="node149.html#benh_unpublished">157</A>],
and oxygen can also complex with many metallic species, from Group II
elements [<A
 HREF="node149.html#henry_NATO">281</A>] to rare earth impurities such as Er
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#er_o">282</A>].
<P><P>

<BR>
<P>
Work of this kind could be accused of being `defect stamp collecting',
<I>i.e.</I> a defect is examined, a structure produced and stuck in the
album, and the process then moves on to the next.  However such
accusations are somewhat unfair.  The real strength of these results
comes from considering them as a whole, in the context of the
additionally available experimental work.  In this way they serve to
show a whole cycle of defect formation processes and how they relate
to the treatment and properties of the sample.
<P>
Applied theoretical modelling such as this fulfils three roles.  Its
first role is to <I>confirm</I>; either to produce results that can be
compared to other calculations performed using different methods, or
to confirm ideas built up from experimental results (see, for example,
results on O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> in this thesis).  More usefully, theory can <I>
explain</I>, <I>i.e.</I> take unexplained, and maybe even apparently
contradictory experimental results, and produce a theory that ties
them all together.  This is true of much of the work in this thesis,
notably the VO<SUB><I>n</I></SUB> work and N/O complexes.  However, the third and
most important job of theory is to <I>predict</I>.  In this case,
theory should identify general mechanisms and trends, suggest new
experiments and techniques, and open up new fields of work.  Ideally
we would like it to be able to provide new ways of examining things,
and find underlying patterns, trends and mechanisms.  It is at this
stage that theory moves far beyond the `stamp collecting' metaphor,
and hopefully this has been achieved with some of the results in this
thesis such as the `wonderbra mechanism'.
