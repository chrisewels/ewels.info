Summary of (CH)-O<SUB><I>ni</I></SUB> defects and further work</A>
</H1>
<P>
In summary, it appears that the (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>-O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> defect forms with
the oxygens in a pair on one side of the (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  This defect is not
a shallow donor defect but has a partially filled level deep in the
gap.  It is unclear whether it would be naturally neutral or -1
charged since this depends on the respective locations of the defect
level and the fermi level, and our Kohn-Sham eigenvalues are not
quantitatively accurate enough for such a prediction.
<P>
When this defect attracts further oxygen atoms to form
(CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>-O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB> this acts as a single shallow donor.  This may
happen through the trapping of a fast diffusing oxygen dimer.  The
donor level is effective mass like, AIMPRO predicts it to sit very
close to the conduction band.  However, on trapping of another
electron, filling the core Si <I>p</I>-type orbital and making the defect
-1 charged, it is able to undergo a structural change by rotating two
of the oxygen atoms on one side of the defect core so that they bow
out of their bond centred sites <I>away</I> from the defect core (in
effect, one side of the wonderbra defect is `popping out').  This
allows the <I>p</I>- lobe of the Si orbital to redistribute the majority of
its charge away from the remaining O atom in the core, and the defect
level drops to mid-gap.  This is indicative of negative-U behaviour,
but within the accuracy of our code we cannot determine whether the
defect is negative-U based on our cluster energies.
<P>
Photo-luminescence work has observed a number of lines such as the I-
and M-lines in Si, which are believed to be C-H-O defects of some kind
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#gower_NATO">222</A>].  It is possible that these are associated with
(CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>n</I></SUB> defects such as these, possibly either (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> or
(CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> (or (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>CO<SUB><I>n</I></SUB>).  Further work would be required
to correctly assign these, however.  The I-line forms after 30 minutes
annealing at 600&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$^\circ$">C, and at this temperature dimers are
unstable.  Its symmetry was found with uniaxial stress to be
monoclinic-I [<A
 HREF="node149.html#gower_NATO">222</A>].  This would exclude (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB>
but could still be (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> since (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> can also sit in a bond
centre with an sp<SUP>2</SUP> coordinated C atom, in which case it could form
a tight pair with the O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> similar to the dimer, and all the defect
atoms would lie in the same <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

be assigned to a (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>ni</I></SUB> defect this would be important, as
it would show proof of pre-cursors to the (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB> STD
