Hydrogen passivation</A>
</H2>
<P>
It is known that hydrogen can passivate thermal donors, in a fully
reversible manner that is only stable to <IMG WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img327.gif"
 ALT="$T \sim 200^\circ$">C
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#jweber_NATO">203</A>].  There are a number of unusual features of this
hydrogen passivation:
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The attempt frequencies for dissociation are at least three
orders of magnitude larger than expected for an atomic jump process.
This could be explained by an associated large lattice relaxation.
<DT>2.
<DD>Dissociation of TD-H occurs in a single stage. Earlier work
suggested this occurred with the same dissociation enthalpy of 1.1&nbsp;eV
for both charge states and different TD<I>n</I>-H species
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#pearton_91">262</A>].  This suggests that a single hydrogen atom
can passivate a double donor, which would not be expected in a simple
`dangling bond' termination model.
<DT>3.
<DD>More recent work [<A
 HREF="node149.html#jweber_NATO">203</A>] showed the dissociation
enthalpy for TD1-H is 1.90&nbsp;eV, whereas for the other TDs is
<IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">1.64&nbsp;eV, suggesting that the binding in TD1-H is different to
the other TDs.  This is consistent with the suggestion that the core
of TD1 is different to the other TDs.
<DT>4.
<DD>Earlier TDs are more effectively passivated than the later ones
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#johnson_86">263</A>].
</DL>
<P>
There are two potential ways in which hydrogen can passivate the
di-y-lid structure.  The simplest is for the H atom to form a Si-H
bond with one of the Si atoms connected by the reconstructed bond at
the top of the defect.  If both of these Si atoms form Si-H bonds,
then they become fully coordinated in combination with their two top
Si-Si bonds and their shared bond.  This allows them to relax away
from the defect core in order to shorten the reconstructed bond.  At
the same time the oxygen atoms can drop back to become divalent and
sit in next-neighbour positions between the core Si atom and the Si
shared with their outer O atom.  This structure is then fully
passivated with no gap states, and exhibits fairly standard Si-H bonds
which should have dissociation enthalpies in the region of the
experimentally observed values.  However, this process requires two H
atoms for full defect passivation, in contradiction with experiment.
<P>
When we attempted to model this by placing H between the core O and
the reconstructed Si atoms, this process began to occur.  However the
structure continued to relax with the H atoms attempting to migrate
around the Si atoms to anti-bonding sites, resulting in extensive
rebonding in the top of the cluster and eventually the breakdown of
the calculation.  This suggests that these Si- bonded sites were not
stable locations for the H, and casts doubt on this passivation
mechanism.
<P>
An alternative way to `passivate' the defect is to place a single H
atom in the centre of the reconstructed Si-Si bond.  This disrupts the
core bonding, and the defect is able to relax backwards into two
standard dimers, possibly with them both buckling in the same
direction instead of towards each other.  This would be a neutral,
electrically inactive defect.  Since H has a partially filled deep
level and the material contains many TDs, etc., this level will fill,
forming H<SUP>-</SUP>.  In this case the H is not covalently bonded to any of
the Si atoms, and any bonding would be Coulombic.  This model
disagrees with experiment, since the H<SUP>-</SUP> still has a filled level
deep in the gap, possibly quite close to the valence band.  However it
is possible that experiments using DLTS were only measuring signals
near to the conduction band (or at least, in the top half of the gap),
and hence registered only the loss of the thermal donor levels and not
the emergence of such a deep level.  We are awaiting further
information on this subject from J. Weber, who has performed the DLTS
experiments.
<P>
This bonding has some similarity with the H<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP> defect.  H<SUP>-</SUP>
normally prefers to sit anti-bonded behind a lattice Si atom.  In the
H<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP> defect, a H<SUP>+</SUP> atom sits at a bond centre and a H<SUP>-</SUP> atom
sits at the neighbouring anti-bonding site.  It is stable to
<IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">150<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C, although two Si-H bonds are formed in this
process.
<P>
In this passivated di-y-lid model, the Coulomb attraction at the
central site is much stronger, although there are no actual Si-H
covalent bonds forming.  The H<SUP>-</SUP> ion is positioned between two very
positive Si atoms, since they both have O neighbours and so are
<IMG WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img253.gif"
 ALT="$\delta+$">.  In addition, each dimer is pushing these Si atoms towards
each other, so the H<SUP>-</SUP> ion is sat closer to the atoms than it would
normally be in a next neighbour site.  For this reason it is feasible
that the binding energy might be higher than that of H<SUB>2</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>, at
<IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">1.6&nbsp;eV.
<P>
The fact that earlier TDs are more effectively passivated could be
because in the larger TDs, the di-y-lid core is relieving the strain
of many surrounding dimers.  There is therefore less energetic
incentive for it to switch back to the double dimer inactive form.
This is similar to the argument as to why earlier TDs exhibit
bistability whereas later ones do not.
<P>
We tried relaxing this model with H in the defect core, overall
charged -1.  As expected the H formed two reasonably strong bonds
(1.540&nbsp;&#197;) with its neighbouring Si atoms, however this was at the
expense of Si-Si bonds to the core Si atom, which dropped down along
<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">001<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;from the defect core.  Thus the resultant structure had
levels in the gap due to this roughly divalent Si, and the H did not
passivate the di-y-lid.  We are currently examining variations on this
structure to see if it is possible to passivate the di-y-lid in this
way with small structural rearrangments.
