Identification of NL10</A>

The recent work of Newman and Ammerlaan [<A
 HREF="node149.html#newman_96">200</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_95">192</A>]
suggests that there are actually at least three different types of STD
defect.  The first, not yet been identified by them, is the N-based
defect of Hara, Suezawa, etc. discussed above.  This defect is stable
to <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">900<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C [<A
 HREF="node149.html#suezawa_88">165</A>].  The second contains hydrogen
and corresponds to at least one of the NL10 EPR signals.  This defect
is stable to 520<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C, and has an electronic IR signal distinct
from that of STDs found in N-rich material [<A
 HREF="node149.html#ron_private">201</A>].
Finally there is a defect that contains Al on the core C<SUB>2</SUB> axis but
no hydrogen [<A
 HREF="node149.html#ammerlaan_95">192</A>], which again has a distinct electronic
IR signal.  None of these can be attributed to thermal donors, since
TDs break down in anneals at 500<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

<P>
We suggest that the first two STD families correspond to those with an
N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> core, and those with a (C-H)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB> core
respectively.  This would be consistent with the experimental
evidence, as well as the thermal stabilities.  N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>-O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> is a
tightly bound defect core and should be highly thermally stable (NNO
is known to be stable to <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">700<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C).  However
(C-H)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB> does not have such tightly bound outer O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms,
and once these have diffused away to leave (C-H)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB>, this is
no longer a shallow donor.  Therefore we would expect this to be
stable to lower temperatures.  In addition, other (C-H) based defects
have similar thermal stabilities; the defect responsible for the
`T-line' observed in PL experiments, (C-H)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB>, is stable to
600&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C [<A
 HREF="node149.html#safonov_96">196</A>], consistent with the idea that the
C-H bond is a strong one.
<P>
Recent work by Newman has shown the H-based and N-based STDs are
indeed two different types of defect[<A
 HREF="node149.html#ron_private">201</A>], and after our
suggestions they are now re-examining their ENDOR results for carbon
related signals.  In their work correlating NL10 to STDs, they
assigned the H-containing NL10 signals to H-passivated TDs
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#newman_96">200</A>].  However in light of the work of Weber <I>et al</I>
(suggesting H-passivated TDs are only stable at low temperatures)
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#jweber_NATO">203</A>], and the discussion above, we believe this to be an
incorrect assignment.  They have also shown that high carbon
concentrations suppress STD formation [<A
 HREF="node149.html#ron_private">201</A>].  This is
similar to the result for nitrogen, and is probably due to several
mechanisms: C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB> forming complexes with dimers, C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>H.
<P>
Strong confirmation of the assignment of (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB> to NL10(H)
has come from recent work by Markevich on the D1, D2 and D3 EPR
centres, where D2 and D3 correspond to NL10(H) centres that form in
hydrogenated irradiated material at the same time that the absorption
signal from C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> disappears.  This is discussed below in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node110.html#popout">8.8</A>.
<P>
Spaeth examined P-doped samples that were subjected to gamma
irradiation [<A
 HREF="node149.html#spaeth_94">216</A>].  This created OV<SUP>-</SUP> centres, which
lowered the fermi level and switched the P from a neutral to a P<SUP>+</SUP>
state.  However the concentration of neutral STD centres remained
unaffected (and actually appeared to increase a little).  They
explained this by suggesting the STD levels must lie relatively deep
in the gap, over 65meV below E<SUB><I>c</I></SUB>.  However an alternative
possibility is that the gamma irradiation was creating Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms,
which in turn liberated more C<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> (through <IMG WIDTH="114" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img311.gif"
 ALT="$\rm C_s + Si_i
\rightarrow C_s$">) and thus created further STDs, similar to the
irradiation production method of Markevich discussed above.  Their
assignment was complicated since the STD absorption only appears as a
shoulder on the larger OV<SUP>-</SUP> absorption.
<P>
A previous study by Jones <I>et al</I> [<A
 HREF="node149.html#jones_90">111</A>] proposed an
Al-based STD consisting of substitutional Al surrounded by two
over-coordinated oxygen atoms, which remains a possible candidate
for the third type of NL10 defect.  However an alternative can be
based around thermal donor models with Al substituting for Si in the
core.  This is examined further in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node136.html#Al_STD">9.5</A>.
