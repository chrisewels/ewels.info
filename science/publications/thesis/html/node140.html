Di-y-lid is TD2 - a serial process</A>
</H2>
<P>
The first of the alternatives is that the di-y-lid is TD2.  The
formation energy of TD1 is initially 1.2&nbsp;eV[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_96">270</A>] and
later reverts to 1.7&nbsp;eV.  In this case the 1.2&nbsp;eV would be the trimer
migration barrier, slightly lower than that of the dimer.  Thus the
1.2&nbsp;eV represents an initial pool of trimers present in the as-grown
material that migrate to form TD1; once these are exhausted the rate
determining step becomes trimer formation and the barrier for this is
1.7&nbsp;eV, <EM>i.e.</EM>  the dimer migration barrier.
<P>
The trimer then migrates until it reaches O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, at which point the
strain energy is sufficient to force it to restructure, giving either
TD1 or TD2.  The structure for TD1 is unclear, but may involve either
a single y-lid or an oxygen `square' structure such as the 4O flanked
square structure discussed above.  TD2 is the di-y-lid.  Now the
di-y-lid and TD1 can restructure into their isomeric electrically
inactive form, which is probably either two dimers separated by a bond
centre, or a linear chain of four O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms.
<P>
We then need to explain why TD1/2 gradually change into TD3, which
becomes dominant.  There are two possibilities here.  The first is
that TD1/2 are mobile (possibly only one of the two species) and
encounter O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, implying TD3 is a 5O species.  However it seems
impossible to design a 5O structure that has the observed C<SUB>2<I>v</I></SUB>
symmetry without putting O on the C<SUB>2</SUB> axis, which is in breach of
ENDOR results.
<P>
The second possibility is that TD1/2 are immobile, and so TD3 forms
through dimer addition to TD1/2.  We next need to explain the
predominance of TD3.  If TD1/2 are formed through rapidly migrating
trimers encountering O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, this should happen very quickly, since the
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> concentration is so high.  However if TD3 relies on TD1/2
trapping a dimer, this requires the meeting of two much lower
concentration species.  The dimer is probably also not migrating as
fast as the trimer.  Hence we would expect TD1/2 to form much more
rapidly than TD3, and there to be no difference in the formation rate
of TD3 and higher order TDs.  We would still expect TD3 to be more
predominant than any other higher order TD species since it is the
first of these (there should be a tailed distribution of these
depending on the binding energy of dimers to each species).  This is a
flaw in this model since it appears to predict more TD1/2 than TD3.
<P>
A possible way around this would be that TD1/2 were unstable and
regularly broke up into two dimers.  However the kinetic analysis of
Newman <I>et al</I> [<A
 HREF="node149.html#mcquaid_95">143</A>] suggests that dimers form through
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> migration.  If TD1/2 broke up into dimers, under this scheme,
they would encounter O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> to form trimers, which would encounter
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> to form TD1/2 once again, and so dimer formation would be a
self-catalysed reaction that did not require O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> diffusion, in
contradiction with their results.
<P>
An alternative is that TD1/2 are mobile, but for some reason on
meeting O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> do not form a thermal donor species.  This seems
unlikely, since no other pure O species are observed apart from quartz
precipitates after long time anneals.  It seems unlikely that O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
would not bind to TD1/2 but a dimer would.  It cannot be that these 5O
species break up into a trimer and a dimer, for the kinetic arguments
given above.  Another more unusual model that appears consistent is to
postulate that as well as TD1/2 trapping dimers to form TD3, there is
a parallel formation stage as they migrate (possibly very slowly) to
O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, and form 5O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> species which are the first step towards quartz
precipitates.
<P>
Annealing studies at 450<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$^\circ$">C (see
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node83.html#fig:hallberg_data">6.11</A>b) show that TD2 forms in the first few
hours, but then tails off with longer anneal time until it practically
disappears after 10-15 hours.  Thereafter there is only trace TD2
signal, however the TD3 signal continues to increase in line with the
trimers; <I>i.e.</I> there is no observed correlation between the TD1/2
trace and TD3.  This loss of TD1/TD2 signal with annealing time
presents a problem to any scheme which requires a serial
transformation from dimer <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

<IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$ \rightarrow $"> TD3, since there should always be some sort of
correlation.  It eliminates the model proposed here in all the forms
discussed above, as well as any scheme that requires a serial
progression through TD1/2 to higher order TDs.
<P>
The only possible way to salvage this model is if TD1/2 are becoming
unstable for some reason (e.g. Fermi level movement, see below), and
they are by-passed in the formation process thereafter, e.g. through
dimer/trimer aggregation.  However this seems unlikely given the low
concentration of dimer and trimer centres.
