The Silicon industry is a 10<SUP>12</SUP> dollar industry worldwide, with Si
technology lying at  the core of  the majority of  computer systems in
use   today.  Si is  the  focus  of   huge amounts  of research,  both
industrially and academically.  Despite this, there is still much that
is not  understood about the  behaviour  of impurities  in  Si, and  a
thorough understanding of the  structure and properties of  impurities
is becoming increasingly important as  devices become smaller and chip
speeds are expected to increase.
<P>
Commercial Si is normally grown using either float zone methods or the
Czochralski<A NAME="tex2html3"
 HREF="footnode.html#226"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A> growth technique
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#czochralski_18">1</A>].  Czochralski growth forms the vast majority due
to the resultant  wafers resistance to   thermal stress, the speed  of
production  and  low cost.   A  schematic diagram  of a Czochralski-Si
grower  is shown in   Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node8.html#fig:czochralski">1.1</A>.  The molten  Si is
contained in a quartz crucible which is  rotated.  A single crystal Si
seed  is placed  on  the  surface  and  gradually  drawn upwards   and
simultaneously rotated;  this  draws the  molten   Si after it   which
solidifies into a continuous crystal extending from the seed.

<P>
Due to the high reactivity of molten Si there are  only a few possible
choices for crucible, and SiO<SUB>2</SUB> is the normal choice.  However  the
SiO<SUB>2</SUB> gradually dissolves  into the melt, releasing large quantities
of oxygen into the Si.  Over 99% of this is lost  as SiO gas from the
molten surface,  but the rest dissolves  into  the single  crystal Si.
Thus Cz-Si has an  extremely  high oxygen concentration (typically  of
the order of 10<SUP>18</SUP> atoms/cm<SUP>3</SUP>, or 1&nbsp;ppm), and oxygen is always
the highest concentration  impurity in Cz-Si<A NAME="tex2html4"
 HREF="footnode.html#292"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A>.   The   solid
solubility of O   in Si is  <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">10<SUP>18</SUP> atoms/cm<SUP>3</SUP> at melting
point [<A
 HREF="node149.html#carlberg_86">3</A>]  but drops by  several orders of magnitude at
room temperature [<A
 HREF="node149.html#mikkelsen_86">4</A>], so there  is a driving force for
precipitation.  For extended  anneals above <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">450<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$^\circ$">C,  small
quartz   precipitates  form   in  the  Si,   accompanied   by  silicon
self-interstitials  (Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>) and dislocation  loops  due to the volume
difference of Si  and SiO<SUB>2</SUB> (quartz  has roughly half the Si density
of pure Si).  This glut of dislocations  causes a large degradation in
mechanical strength of the silicon (the yield  point drops by a factor
of almost  5 [<A
 HREF="node149.html#shimura_94">5</A>]).  Similarly,  oxygen causes warpage of
the Si wafers during processing.
<P>
However, oxygen behaves differently   when Cz-Si is annealed at  lower
temperatures.   Annealing at around   450<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C for  several  hours
leads to a  change in the electrical resistivity  of the Si, and it is
now known  that this is due to   the formation of <I>thermal double
donors</I>, oxygen based  defects with double  donor levels close to  the
conduction    band.     These   can   form    with concentrations   of
<IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">10<SUP>16</SUP>cm<SUP>-3</SUP>,  significantly  degrading the performance of
the Si.  Higher  temperature   annealing removes these  (`donor  kill'
processing),    however there is  interest  in  lowering the annealing
temperatures  required during   processing.  High temperature  anneals
allow greater defect  migration and  increased interfacial  diffusion,
both of  which become crucial in extremely  small devices.  As well as
thermal donors there are various other families of shallow donors that
form,  including the <I>shallow  thermal donors</I>, which form over an
extremely wide  temperature range  (some of these    are stable up  to
900<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C),   as  well  as  the `new    donors' which  form  in the
500-600&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C temperature  range  after the  thermal donors anneal
out.
<P>
The obvious way to avoid these defects would be to minimise the amount
of oxygen in the  material.  There are various  ways to achieve  this.
One particularly successful method is  to  place large magnetic  coils
around        the    molten        Si        bath      (`MCZ',      or
Magnetic-field-applied-Czochralski).  The resultant fields control the
convection fluid flow,  allowing the operator  to minimise the  mixing
between  the liquid in the centre  of the bath with  that at the edge.
This effectively creates  a liquid Si  crucible around the central  Si
bath, which  can trap much of the  oxygen and slow  its migration into
the crystal[<A
 HREF="node149.html#tkacheva_NATO">6</A>].  This process drops the final thermal
donor concentrations by over an order of magnitude, but cannot provide
a final solution to the  problem, since oxygen   is needed within  the
crystal.    As well as forming   unwanted electrically active defects,
oxygen    performs a number   of very    useful roles.    It   can pin
dislocations,  which greatly strengthens  the crystal.  Float-zone Si,
which contains over two orders of magnitude less oxygen than Cz-Si, is
too soft for most  commercial  applications and crumbles  very easily.
Oxygen also acts  as a gettering agent for  trace metal impurities  in
the crystal (`intrinsic gettering').  Oxygen precipitates in the wafer
core suppress stacking faults [<A
 HREF="node149.html#rozgonyi_76">7</A>], and oxygen makes the
Si more  resistant to thermal stress during   processing.  This is the
primary reason why Cz-Si is used for  integrated circuit design, where
there are many thermal processing steps.
<P>
Thus  to some  extent  we are  stuck  with  the problem of  the oxygen
related donor  defects in Si.  Given this  state of affairs, there are
two available courses.  Firstly to develop alternative treatments that
minimise the  donor  defect concentration without  dropping the oxygen
concentration (through  alternative heat treatments, addition of other
impurities, and   possibly  even more     exotic  treatments such   as
irradiation).    Secondly    it is known      that  the formation  and
distribution  of these defects is  crucially  dependent on the initial
condition of  the Si<A NAME="tex2html5"
 HREF="footnode.html#250"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A>.
Therefore with improved pre-treatments  and processing we may  be able
to tweak these   to our favour,   and  in practise any  solution  will
probably be a combination of both of these.
<P>
In  order   to pursue this   approach,  it is    obvious that detailed
knowledge  is required of the behaviour  of impurities in Si.  Notably
the defect structures and formation  processes, as well as the primary
impurity  complexes  and their diffusion  mechanisms,  need to be well
understood.  Si is the  most   studied semiconductor material  in  the
world.  Despite  this, more than forty  years of research into thermal
donors<A NAME="tex2html6"
 HREF="footnode.html#293"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A> still leaves  many fundamental
questions  unanswered, including their structure,  and their method of
formation.  Some of  the more  important questions   that need to   be
addressed are as follows:
<P><UL>
<LI>What are the structures and formation processes for thermal
      donors and shallow thermal donors?
<LI>What is the role, if any, of silicon self-interstitials, both as
      a part of defect structures such as thermal donors, and as a
      catalyst for defect formation through enhanced migration or
      pre-cursor formation?
<LI>What is the role, if any, for oxygen dimers?  To what extent do
      pairs of oxygen atoms control defect formation at lower
      temperatures?
</UL>
<P>
The last two are addressed in Chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="node69.html#dimers">6</A> and <A HREF="node116.html#thermal">9</A>.
The  structure and mechanisms  for   the  shallow thermal donors   are
addressed  in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node98.html#stds">8</A>.  We present a  model for the thermal
donor core in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node116.html#thermal">9</A>.  Although this does not provide a
complete answer  to the  thermal donor problem,  I have  included some
discussion  of this and  pointers  towards an eventual solution, drawn
from these results and the available experimental data.
<P>
As well  as  oxygen,  there are many   other light  element impurities
present in Si, either through accident or design.  These will interact
with oxygen in various  ways, forming many different defect complexes.
Nitrogen  is not very soluble  in  Si, but  can  be incorporated in  a
variety of ways, either through  annealing in an N<SUB>2</SUB> atmosphere, ion
implantation,  or  through  addition of  Si<SUB>3</SUB>N<SUB>4</SUB> to  the Si melt.
Nitrogen helps to suppress  `swirl defects' in the  Si and stops wafer
bowing during processing.  It is  also known to suppress thermal donor
formation.  Nitrogen is electrically inactive  in Si, and is known  to
suppress   vacancy and interstitial  defects   and increase gate oxide
integrity [<A
 HREF="node149.html#vonammon_96">9</A>].  Si<SUB>3</SUB>N<SUB>4</SUB> is also used as a diffusion
barrier.  These effects are, in part at  least, due to the interaction
between nitrogen and oxygen.
<P>
Hydrogen is an extremely complex impurity in semiconductors.  It is
now believed to be present in most Si samples<A NAME="tex2html7"
 HREF="footnode.html#294"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A>.  It is normally used in
semiconductor  materials    as   a  passivating   element,  saturating
electrically  active dangling   bonds  associated with    other defect
centres.  However,   its  behaviour is  more   complex  than that.  In
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node47.html#inp">4</A> we show that in III-V materials a fully hydrogenated
vacancy  behaves as   a  single shallow  donor,   and in  InP  this is
responsible for charge compensation of  iron dopants.  In addition, in
conjunction   with  other  elements  such   as carbon  we   suggest in
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node98.html#stds">8</A> that hydrogen may  also be responsible for some  of
the  shallow  thermal donors  observed  in silicon.   A  full study of
oxygen-hydrogen interactions in silicon  is beyond the scope  of this
thesis.
<P>
Carbon is always   present in concentrations  of  at  least <IMG WIDTH="68" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$5 \times
10^{15}$">&nbsp;cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, and can form a variety of complexes with oxygen in
both  its substitutional and interstitial  forms.  C-O complexes will
be  covered fully in  the PhD  of Paul Leary,   but some discussion of
their formation and behaviour is included here where relevant.
<P>
Finally,  we  examine the interaction    between oxygen and vacancies.
Vacancies and self-interstitials    can be introduced  into   Si  in a
variety  of ways.   Irradiation produces many   intrinsic defects, and
although most immediately recombine, it  is still  the easiest way  to
produce  large  quantities of   vacancies (V)  and  self-interstitials
(Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>).  Proton  irradiation hydrogenates the vacancies and prevents
recombination, leading to an  excess of Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  SiO<SUB>2</SUB> precipitation
also creates Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, and  these aggregate into rod-like defects (RLDs)
that lie  along <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">311<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$"> planes.    Annealing Si in N<SUB>2</SUB>
gas leads to Si<SUB>3</SUB>N<SUB>4</SUB> precipitation on the  surface, which sends a
`wind'  of vacancies into the  bulk.   Vacancies are known to  complex
with oxygen and suppress   thermal donor formation,  and the   role of
Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> in the formation of thermal  donors is a hotly contested issue.
Complexes involving Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> are  not believed to be stable at
normal annealing temperatures and break down at low temperatures
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#abdullin_95">12</A>].  However vacancy-oxygen defects are common, and
precipitate instead of thermal donors.  The vacancy-oxygen centre, or
`A centre' (OV<SUP>-</SUP>), is the most common impurity in electron
irradiated Cz-Si at room temperature.  We therefore examine various
vacancy-oxygen defects, and show how vacancies act as precipitation
centres for oxygen.
<P>
Our calculations are performed using AIMPRO, a density functional code
working under the local density approximation (LDA).  The method is
<I>ab initio</I>, <I>i.e.</I> the only experimental input required is
the atomic number of the elements involved.  The calculations use
large molecular clusters to simulate bulk crystal.  These clusters
contain from 35 to 98 bulk atoms, and have their surface dangling
bonds terminated with hydrogen atoms (a typical 134 atom cluster is
shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node51.html#fig:inp_clus">4.1</A>a)<A NAME="tex2html8"
 HREF="footnode.html#272"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A>.  The defect
structure is inserted into the centre of these clusters and some or
all of the atoms allowed to relax to their ground state.  Thus we are
able to accurately describe the structure and symmetry of point
defects.  The calculated Kohn-Sham eigenvalues also provide
semi-quantitative information about the localised electronic states of
the defects.  Determination of the energy second derivatives for the
core defect atoms also allows us to calculate the local vibrational
modes of defects with different atomic isotopes, which can be directly
compared to experiment.  By relaxing various alternative structures it
is possible to determine defect binding energies, and by applying
constraints to the relaxation to hold the cluster at a saddle point,
barriers to migration can be determined.
<P>
In Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node9.html#theory">2</A>     the theoretical background   to  AIMPRO is
discussed.  This  includes  Hartree  Fock,  Thomas Fermi  Theory   and
Density Functional Theory, as well as some of the approximations used.
Also  included is a discussion  of  other theoretical methods commonly
used to examine oxygen defects in Si, such as CNDO.
<P>
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node26.html#aimpro">3</A> describes the formalism used within AIMPRO.  This
includes discussion of the advantages  and disadvantages of the method
used,  including the role    of  clusters, hydrogen termination    and
localised Gaussian basis sets.
<P>
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node47.html#inp">4</A> is concerned with   hydrogenated defects in InP  and
GaAs.  It is first shown that  hydrogenated vacancies can form a range
of electrically active defects, from VH<SUB>4</SUB>, which is a single shallow
donor, to VH, which acts as a double  acceptor.  VH<SUB>4</SUB> is shown to be
responsible for  the charge  compensation of  iron  in InP.   The role
played by hydrogen in passivating group II acceptor impurities such as
Be and Mg is also examined.  The  work is extended to passivated Group
II  acceptors  in GaAs to examine   trends with material  type, and is
closely tied  to experimental research performed   by Bernard Pajot in
Paris.
<P>
The other results chapters  are concerned with oxygen- related defects
in   silicon.    Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node57.html#vacancy">5</A>   examines   the    range    of
vacancy-oxygen defects, V<SUB><I>n</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>m</I></SUB>,  <I>n</I>=1,2, <I>m</I>=1,3.  For the first
time, coupled with   experimental  work from &#197;rhus,  Denmark,   we
unambiguously  show   that VO<SUB>2</SUB> is  defect  responsible  for   the
889&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> local vibrational   mode (LVM).   A  discussion of  the
annealing behaviour of V<SUB><I>n</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>m</I></SUB> defects is  included, as well as the
role of oxygen dimers.
<P>
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node69.html#dimers">6</A> examines the interstitial oxygen dimer, O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB>.
This defect is believed to be responsible for the low formation energy
of the thermal donors from 350-400<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C, and it has been suggested
that it  has a lower  migration barrier  than O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  In collaboration
with experimental work  done at Link&#246;ping by Lennart&nbsp;Lindstr&#246;m and
Tomas  Hallberg,  we show  the  oxygen dimer   is responsible for  the
1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> LVM  observed  in Cz-Si<A NAME="tex2html9"
 HREF="footnode.html#282"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A>.   Our  calculations show  that the dimer   is at least
metastable in a puckered assymetric form, and does indeed have a lower
migration   barrier.  The migration  mechanism is  discussed.  We also
extend the argument to larger oxygen complexes such as the trimer, and
discuss  the role   of  the dimer  in  the  formation  of other defect
complexes in Si.
<P>
Nitrogen-Oxygen defects are examined  in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node88.html#nitrogen">7</A>.   We
show that the primary  N-O defect in  silicon  is the NNO defect,  or
N<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  This is  electrically inactive  and consists of  O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>
neighbouring an interstitial  nitrogen pair.   This  work was done  in
collaboration with Frank Berg    Rasmussen and Brian Bech Nielsen   at
&#197;rhus, Denmark.    We  also examine   the  N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> defect   and
correlate it with a set of previously unassigned LVMs.
<P>
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node98.html#stds">8</A> deals with the <I>shallow  thermal donors</I> and is
to  some  extent  the  core   of   the  thesis.   We show   that  both
N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> and (CH)<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>4<I>i</I></SUB> can  form shallow thermal  donors,
and probably lie   at the core of   two of the   shallow thermal donor
families in Si (responsible for some of the  NL10 defects).  A general
mechanism (the `wonderbra mechanism') is described for turning defects
with  deep donor  levels  into shallow  donor   level defects, through
electrostatic compression by O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  This  is shown to operate for the
shallow   thermal donors  described here.     The   relevance of  this
mechanism for thermal donors,   and possibilities for   application to
other materials is also discussed.  This work arose from collaboration
with Jo Miro and Peter  De&#225;k, theoretical researchers from Budapest.
As  an area of  active ongoing research, we  are currently involved in
discussion  with experimental  researchers working on  this problem in
Japan, London, Amsterdam and St&#252;ttgart.
<P>
Thermal   donors (TDs) are   examined  in  Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node116.html#thermal">9</A>.   We
propose  a core   structure for the    thermal donor based around  two
tri-valent  oxygen atoms, and  account   for the various  experimental
data.  We also discuss how the family  of thermal donors can form, and
possible structures for higher order TDs.  A model is proposed for the
NL10(Al) shallow thermal donor centre.
<P>
In   Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node148.html#conclusions">10</A>,   final  conclusions   are  drawn  and
suggestions made  for further work.  Some  general observations on the
behaviour of oxygen-related species in Si  are made, and the relevance
of this work to the problem of thermal donors is discussed.
