Clusters</A>
</H2>
 <A NAME="sec:clus">&#160;</A>
Clusters have many advantages over periodic systems, one of the
strongest of these being the variety of symmetries that can be
accurately reproduced by producing a cluster of the correct
proportions.  This makes symmetry constraining point defects much
easier, and allows easy examination of extended structure defects such
as line defects (the non-zero Burgers vector means that it is
impossible to handle a single line defect in a supercell and they must
be constructed in groups with cancelling Burgers vectors).  Since a
cluster is not periodically repeated it is easy to calculate induced
dipole moments.
<P>
Charged species are easier to handle with clusters, since the number
of electrons can be arbitrarily fixed.  In a supercell an overall
non-neutral charge would be infinitely repeated leading to an infinite
system charge.  This problem is avoided by adding an equivilent
opposite uniform background charge to the supercell to maintain its
charge neutrality.  Such problems become worse when, for example,
applying an external electric field; whereas with clusters a uniform
field can be used, for a supercell it has to be a sawtooth field in
order to keep the field continuous from one cell to its
neighbour[<A
 HREF="node149.html#lamoen_96">46</A>].
<P>
However, clusters also have several disadvantages.  The main one of
these is the potential for interaction between the cluster surface and
the defect contained within.  This problem is avoided when supercells
are used, but instead is replaced with potential defect-defect
interaction between neighbouring supercells.  Finite cluster size can
also constrain electron delocalisation.  Hopefully defect-surface
interaction should be minimised with the use of increasingly large
clusters as we have access to more powerful computing facilities.
Such surface effects can be seen in small polyaromatic carbon sheets
used to simulate graphite, where the edge termination can impose a
Kekul&#233; structure across the sheet if it is too small.  It is
sometimes useful to repeat calculations in different cluster sizes to
check the dependancy of the result on surface proximity.
Alternatively repeating a calculation with surface hydrogen atoms held
fixed and then allowed full relaxation gives an indication of surface
effect depending on the degree of relaxation.
<P>
Using finite clusters increases the calculated bandgap of
semiconductor material due to the surface confinement; this works
against density functional theory which tends to decrease band
gaps<A NAME="tex2html20"
 HREF="footnode.html#2283"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="foot_motif.gif"></SUP></A>.
<P>
Zinc-Blende type clusters present an additional problem over their
diamond lattice equivilents, due to the different valency of the two
atomic species present.  If such a cluster is atom centred and
radially symmetric, it will terminate with an outer shell of only one
atomic species, so the cluster will be non-stoichiometric.  In order
to have each covalent bond fully populated it is then necessary to
charge the cluster (e.g.  a `neutral' 131 atom <IMG WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img193.gif"
 ALT="$\rm
In_{31}P_{40}H_{60}$"> cluster has a charge of +9 to remove the excess P
electrons).  The alternative is a bond centred stoichiometric cluster.
Although this does not have to be artificially charged, there will be
a net cluster dipole due to the non-symmetric arrangement of atoms,
and this leads to anisotropy in the bonds.  The effect of these two
types of cluster on the core defect structure and vibrational modes
can be seen in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node47.html#inp">4</A>.
<P>
The use of clusters with a fixed electronic charge means that it is
sometimes possible to obtain unphysical solutions.  For example with
highly delocalised states such as effective-mass type states, these
are normally very delocalised in physical systems.  However in a
cluster approach they are forced to remain within the confines of the
cluster and hence can artifically occupy anti-bonding states, etc.
For problems such as the thermal donors this can be surmounted by
running the defects in their ionised charge state, and the effect of
localisation can be tested by then checking the structural change when
the donor electrons are added once more.
