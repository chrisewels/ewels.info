<P>
One of the fascinating aspects of this model is that this is a new
mechanism for the formation of shallow donor levels, and only
initially requires a defect with a deep level state.  In effect the
compressive neighbouring O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms act to form a localised quantum
well that contains the electronic gap state.  This quantum well is
compressed due to the Coulombic repulsion and dative bonding of the
confining atoms, and this increases the energy of the locally confined
electronic state, which is trapped in this well.
<P>
There are many implications of this work beyond the direct attempt to
determine the structure of STDs.  This mechanism could provide a
mechanism for creating shallow donor levels in a wide range of
materials, including commercially important shallow donors in diamond.
Ultimately it may even be possible to attempt
defect level engineering, treating a material in such a way as
to produce defects with energetically squeezed&nbsp; levels lying at
precisely the energies required for device design.
<P>
In order that the wonderbra mechanism can operate, a core defect has
to have only two fundamental properties:
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>It must possess a deep lying gap state.  Although the precise depth 
is not important, a relatively localised level is useful since the
compression mechanism is also relatively localised, so it helps if the
electronic state is initially confined.
<DT>2.
<DD>It has to be able to attract further defect atoms in order to
confine and compress the gap state; the spatial arrangement of this
gap state will be important in this respect.
<P></DL>
<P>
It is possible to imagine various ways in which this could occur,
although the <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$\langle$">110<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;type N-O<SUB>2</SUB> structure is possibly one of the
simplest.  For example, a similar mechanism could operate through a
<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$\langle$">111<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\rangle$">&nbsp;dangling bond state, which could be compressed by a non-bonded
substitutional atom sitting on the original neighbour site.  A third
caveat is that where the electrostatic attraction towards the defect
core is only weak, such as in the (CH)- shallow thermal donors, some
form of external compression may also have to be applied, such as by
the addition of further O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> atoms.
<P>
The mechanism provides an alternative method for producing shallow
donor states in materials that are traditionally hard to dope, for
example, <I>n</I>- type diamond[<A
 HREF="node149.html#prins_95">224</A>].  Instead of finding ways of
introducing shallow dopants, the challenge now becomes one of finding
ways to compress deep donor states already available in the material
in order to shift them upwards in the gap.  It is possible to dope
diamond with substitutional nitrogen, which in the neutral charge
state has a donor level 1.7&nbsp;eV below the conduction band
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#vermeulen_la">225</A>].  This sits in an anti-bonding orbital between N and one
of its C neighbours, and hence N does not remain on the <I>T</I><SUB><I>d</I></SUB> lattice
site but instead drifts away to form a <I>C</I><SUB>3<I>v</I></SUB> defect.  It could be
imagined that the anti-bonded C could be replaced with some other
defect such as Ge, Si, O or F in order to compress the N donor state
through this mechanism.  However in practise incorporating such
impurities is extremely difficult.  In addition any charge
redistribution effects will be less marked due to the higher
electronegativity of C than Si, and so any application of the
wonderbra mechanism to diamond doping will probably be more
complicated than this.  Another alternative source of this mechanism
could come through sp<SUP>2</SUP> hybridised carbon atoms where the filled
non-bonded <I>p</I>- orbital could be compressed.
<P>
Some preliminary test calculations by Latham and Jones have shown that
a N<SUB><I>s</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> structure similar to that described above is
potentially a single shallow donor in diamond [<A
 HREF="node149.html#latham_private">226</A>].
This could prove useful, as N<SUB><I>s</I></SUB> is a common impurity in diamond.
The challenge is now thrown open to experimental groups to determine
ways in which these defects can be constructed in real materials.
