The 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> LVM</A>
</H2>
<P>
Until recently no LVMs were assigned to the oxygen dimer.  However it
has been suggested that a vibrational mode at 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> (first
observed in 1972 [<A
 HREF="node149.html#bean_72">146</A>]) could be due to the oxygen dimer
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#markevich_NATO">147</A>].
<P>
There are several reasons for this. Firstly it is present after heat
treatments at a wide range of temperatures: 650<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$^\circ$">C
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#lindstrom_94">102</A>,<A

 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$^\circ$">C [<A
 HREF="node149.html#pajot_85">148</A>], as well as in as-grown material at
concentrations of about <IMG WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img240.gif"
 ALT="$1.5\times10^{15}$">cm<SUP>-3</SUP>
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_96">270</A>].  The line is definitely oxygen related given
its 43&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> isotopic shift when going from <SUP>16</SUP>O to <SUP>18</SUP>O
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>].  Its annealing properties (discussed in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node83.html#sec:exp_disc">6.5.1</A>) are also consistent with that of a rapidly
diffusing dimer.  Given that it is present over such a range of
conditions it seems sensible that it should be the simplest oxygen
complex possible, namely a dimer.
<P>
Assuming that the 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> mode is responsible for the dimer,
simple rate equation analysis led to a binding energy in the range 0.1
<IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img241.gif"
 ALT="$\leq$"> E<SUB><I>b</I></SUB> <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img241.gif"
 ALT="$\leq$"> 0.2&nbsp;eV [<A
 HREF="node149.html#markevich_NATO">147</A>].  This is
consistent with the idea that the dimer should not be important in the
kinetics of TD formation at higher temperatures [<A
 HREF="node149.html#newman_NATO">272</A>].
Fits to plots of Log[1012] vs. Log(1/T) gave a more accurate dimer
binding energy of 0.16&nbsp;eV [<A
 HREF="node149.html#markevich_NATO">147</A>,<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>].  Recent
detailed analysis has suggested a figure of <IMG WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img242.gif"
 ALT="$\rm E_b = 0.3 \pm
0.05$">&nbsp;eV [<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_ICDS">150</A>].
<P>
In addition to the 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> mode, there is a secondary weaker
mode at 1006&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> which is normally observed under the same
conditions.  It is also present in as-grown material, but at
concentrations of about <IMG WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img243.gif"
 ALT="$1.5\times10^{14}$"> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_96">270</A>], and shows similar annealing properties.  If
the 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> mode is produced by the dimer, given that the most
common defect in silicon is O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, it is likely that the
1006&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> mode is caused by the oxygen trimer, O<SUB>3<I>i</I></SUB>.  Little
is known about this defect, but crucially, from fitting their models
to experimental data, Markevich and Murin showed the fits were greatly
improved for the 1006&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> mode if they assumed that this defect
was highly mobile [<A
 HREF="node149.html#markevich_NATO">147</A>].
<P>
There is a strong correlation between the 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> band and the
1107 band due to O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> [<A
 HREF="node149.html#lindstrom_94">102</A>].  The band shows very
little temperature dependance (unlike O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, suggesting any bonding in
the defect is very different to O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>); it shifts from 1013 to
1012.2&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> on going from 300K to 10K.  With <SUP>18</SUP>O it drops to
969&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.  It is always present in as-grown material.
<P>
After we suggested a dimer should give rise to more modes, further
examination has determined modes at 1105 and 1062&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>
(1060&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> at 10K) which are correlated with the 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_private">151</A>].  The 1062&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> mode is nearly twice
as intense as the other two, and is very broad (FWHM <IMG WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">7 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>
at 10K).  More recently the 1105&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> was shown to be
unconnected.  There are also two lower modes at 685 and 552&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>,
the 552&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> exhibiting only a small shift with oxygen isotope.
<P>
Further evidence has come from irradiation experiments by Lindstr&#246;m
and Hallberg [<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_ICDS">150</A>].  Electron irradiated material was
annealed, giving a high concentration of VO<SUB>2</SUB> centres.  This was
then proton irradiated (which leads to Si<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> production), and using
FTIR a decrease in the VO<SUB>2</SUB> 889&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> signal was observed
concurrently with the appearance of lines at 1012 and 1062&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.
This is consistent with the reaction <IMG WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img244.gif"
 ALT="$\rm VO_2 + Si_i
\rightarrow O_{2i}$">.<P>
The 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> band is not seen in C-rich material
[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>], where presumably most dimers are being trapped by
C<SUB><I>s</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>n</I></SUB> complexes.
<P>
Note that there is another, electrically active, defect that forms
after long time annealing, which also possesses a LVM at
1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.  The FWHP of this new 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> is much broader
than the early 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> line and rapidly swamps it.  This is
also correlated with a lower mode at 744&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP>.  These modes come
from a fundamentally different defect and should not be confused with
the dimer modes.  This mode overlap originally led to incorrect
assignment of the 1012&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> line to some sort of shallow thermal
donor centre[<A
 HREF="node149.html#hallberg_NATO">239</A>].
