Conclusions and Discussion</A>
</H1>
<P>
Our conclusion is that the structure shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node94.html#fig:nno">7.4</A>
represents the NNO defect, the primary N-O complex in silicon.  The
NNO defect has no deep or shallow donor levels, and so is not
responsible for shallow thermal donors (see Section <A HREF="node98.html#stds">8</A>).
<P>
The three atoms of the defect are only weakly dynamically coupled
because of their inequivalence.  The O atom is bound to the defect
because the N-pair strains the lattice.  The dissociation barrier of
the NNO complex is then approximately the energy necessary for O to
migrate to the barrier top starting from O lying between Si(6) and
Si(5) and ending between Si(5) and Si(1).  Taking the first figure to
be that for O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> diffusion, 2.5 eV [<A
 HREF="node149.html#mikkelsen_86">4</A>] and the second
one as calculated here, 1.2&nbsp;eV, we find this dissociation barrier to
be 3.7 eV.  The equilibrium concentration of NNO defects would equal,

 ALT="\begin{displaymath}
\frac{[N_2] [O_i]} { N_s} e^{(1.2eV/kT)}, \end{displaymath}"></P>
where <I>N</I><SUB><I>s</I></SUB> is the
density of bond-center sites for O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  The formation energy of NNO
from N<SUB>2</SUB> and O defects is estimated to be around 1.2 eV which gives
a concentration of NNO equal to that of N<SUB>2</SUB> below 800<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

<P>
We remark that as the trapping of O by N pairs has been attributed to
the strain field surrounding the pair, then this mechanism would be
also be expected to operate for other impurities. H and F would behave
like O. However, C would be expected to substitute for Si atoms
compressed by the pairs whereas Ge and substitutional transition
metals would replace Si atoms subject to tensile stress. This would
lead to <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="33" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$\rangle$"> oriented aggregates.
<P>
In addition we conclude that the 813 and 1020&nbsp;cm<SUP>-1</SUP> vibrational
modes are produced by the N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> defect.  This is present in much
smaller concentrations than the standard NNO defect, and acts as a
deep donor defect similar to N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>.  It will form as a pre-cursor to
either NNO or the N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> shallow thermal donor, depending on
whether it traps N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> or O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>, and this adds weight to our claim
that N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB>2<I>i</I></SUB> can form in N/O codoped material (see
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node98.html#stds">8</A>).  The two models examined above differ in that the
NNOO model has no gap levels at all, whereas the N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> model has
a single deep donor state.  Therefore it should be possible to
experimentally verify that the defect is N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB>O<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> rather than NNOO,
for example through detection of an associated deep level using DLTS
(although this may prove difficult to distinguish from other centres
in the material) or else electronic transition IR.
<P>
An important question that needs to be addressed when discussing the
kinetics and formation of N/O defects is the migration process for
N<SUB>2</SUB> pairs.  It is currently unknown whether the N atoms are able to
diffuse as a pair, or have to break up into individual N<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> before
diffusing and later recombining.  An experiment which may be able to
distinguish between these two is as follows [<A
 HREF="node149.html#brian_thanks">182</A>].  A
sample should be ion implantated using <SUP>14</SUP>N and briefly annealed,
so the N forms pairs of <SUP>14</SUP>N.  The sample is then similarly ion
implanted, but using <SUP>15</SUP>N; another quick anneal should pair these
atoms off, leaving a collection of <SUP>14</SUP>N and <SUP>15</SUP>N nitrogen
pairs, but very few mixed isotope pairs.  This can be verified by
FTIR, before performing a longer time anneal.  If, after the
annealing, the sample shows a spread of pure and mixed isotope pairs,
then this suggests the pairs are breaking up and reforming.  However
if the pure isotopic pairs are maintained then it suggests that the
N atoms diffuse as a pair.
