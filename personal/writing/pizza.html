<i>Dateline: Somewhere in New Britain, 2nd May 1997, 12.01 am.</i><p>

Real theorists do it from first principles; wasn't that the boast we'd
always made back in my days at the department?

<p>
I  pulled another slug  from the  bottle,  tipped my hat back  with my
forefinger, and wiped my shirt cuff  across my brow for the thousandth
time.  There was something about this case that just didn't add up, no
matter how  long I  stared  at the numbers  tumbling  down my computer
screen.
<p>
I remembered a similar case I once worked on, years back when the city
was cleaner and I  still thought I could sort  out all of the  world's
problems.  Now I didn't even know if I could sort out any of my own.
<p>
I  cast my mind  back, digging through  the  alcoholic haze, trying to
remember how that old case from my Group IV days had panned out. Yeah,
that was it....

<p>
There'd been this antimony, hanging  around with the smoothest hunk of
silicon  you've ever seen.   It all looked  on the level; well, on the
surface, at least.   Turns out they  were working together to pull off
some kind of undisclosed optoelectronic job.
<p>
Seems  the antimony  was cruising  round the  silicon surface in twos,
looking for  trouble -  whenever  other atoms showed  up, the antimony
just smeared  them across the surface flatter  than a suicide  off the
12th floor.  Heck,   it  was  almost  a  public service,    preventing
overcrowding, but I'd smelled a rat.  Sure  enough, they'd been caught
charging for their  little ``surfactant  racket''. Electrostatically, of
course, but it still wasn't legal.
<p>
Well, I'd cleaned that one  up, but you know how  it is with antimony,
you  can build  a  case as watertight  as  the  QE2 and still  somehow
nothing manages to stick....

<p>
Just a few weeks later, it'd shown  up again, this time hanging around
on germanium.  Same setup, same old routine - we'd  gone in and closed
that  one up so   quick you could've heard the   casebook snap  shut a
hundred miles away.  But  the story was so  similar it'd stayed in the
notepad, so the public never got to hear about it.

<p>
Now someone else  was nosing round the same  patch that I'd cleaned up
all those years  ago, and it looked  like they might be onto something
big, maybe something really big.   If only I'd  dug  a bit deeper  the
first time around....
<p>

Damn!  Hindsight  was one cruel  mistress.  With that bitter thought I
slipped  into some other unwanted memories,  scowled, and drew another
long slug from the bottle.   I knew  the drinking  should stop, but  I
promised myself `Hell, just to the end of this case...'
<p>
The obvious difference this time round was some  new evidence from the
boys in  forensic.  They'd come up with  a whole bunch  of data on the
modus operandi of antimony, and not all of it fitted the profile I had
in   my  mind. I  stared  at the  file, wishing   I   could've seen it
sooner. Seems they  had a  hunch  antimony was getting  all twisted up
when  it got  near germanium in   a  way it didn't  when   it was with
silicon. But that just wasn't how I saw it....

<p>
This one was too tricky to solve alone, so I thought I'd try it out on
the  new boy in town,  Eddie 'Tricky fingers'  McGraw.   He was a good
kid, if a bit green between the ears.

<p>

I remember when I used to be in his shoes; picking up all the bum jobs
that the old timers won't touch with  a bargepole, just trying to make
a name  for yourself,  build up a  rep.  Bet  he still  thinks  he can
change the world, too.
<p>
Outside  a cat would've  knocked over a dustbin  and howled off down a
side alley, if we weren't halfway up a tower block.

<p>
Eddie tried  hard,  but he just   wasn't getting it, and  spilling the
story to him  didn't help straighten out my  addled thoughts any.   He
suggested we head out  to Shady Jane's, clean  out some of her Bourbon
and shoot some pool into  the small hours, but  in the end I sent  him
off on his own; there was no way I'd be enjoying  myself until I'd got
the weight of this case off of my chest.

<p>

<p>
I woke up in the morning with my face pressed into the computer screen
and the empty  bottle wedged between the mouse  and the keyboard.  The
ridges of sunlight were streaming  straight through the blinds into my
eyes and my head was about fit to split.

<p>
About that point Eddie walks in, whistling, glass of water in one hand
and two tablets  in the other.  He  grins, says, 'how's the head?' and
hands me the  tablets and water.  And just  about then I want to  wipe
his  smiley-arse, cheery, 'I-won-a-bunch-of-money-and-got-laid'  looks
all over the wall, 'cos I know that the only thing I got closer to the
bottom of last night was the whisky bottle, and the case is still just
as unsolved as when I started.

<p>
Still, three weeks later and it all  just dropped into place. Like I'd
always suspected,  antimony turned out to be   pulling the same racket
around germanium  as it had on silicon.   But this time round  I could
prove it, and I'd  pinned down every  irritating little difference  so
tight you could've sold 'em to a politician.  Better still, Eddie blew
all his   ill-gotten gains  on my  tip-off  for  a horse called  ``Big
Science'', so I guess at least the story ended with a smile.
