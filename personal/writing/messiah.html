<h2>The Technological Messiah </h2>
<h3>A highly short play by Chris Ewels</h3>
</center>
<p>

<ul>
<h3>Cast</h3>
<strong>Man</strong> - A middle/old aged, stressed from life but maybe
originally nice natured.<br>
<strong>Other</strong> - Person of indeterminant age, dressed in
black, a Sony stack system personified.
</ul>

<p>
<p>

Center of the stage is the Other, bent double and obviously in
pain. Man enters from side, sees Other and rushes over to try and help
him. He looks worried. Other suddenly cries out and stands up, and
spreads his arms, goes briefly blank, then looks weak and leans on the
other man's shoulders.<p>

<i>(NB: The Man should get gradually less sympathetic and more cynical
and angry, although most of the anger should be saved for the
end.)</i>

<p><strong>Man: </strong>My God, are you all right? Call an ambulance!
Somebody call an ambulance!

<p><strong>Other: </strong>No, no, it's alright, I'm fine now. I
sometimes have these moments

<p><strong>Man: </strong>Whatever happened?

<p><strong>Other: </strong>Somebody ran out of video tape. <i>(Still a
bit dazed)</i>

<p><strong>Man: </strong> <i>(perplexed)</i> I'm sorry?

<p><strong>Other: </strong> <i>(Pauses, then reaches a decision)</i> Have you
ever wondered whether a video might dream?

<p><i>(Man can continue to be perplexed and ad lib around this)</i>

<p>What do you think the dreams of a video would be like? Huge vistas
of images, drifting through a sea of words and pictures, collections
and arguments and tear jerkers and soundbites, and big frights, and
wild love and flower buds and then - suddenly - the tape runs out! If
it's a disappointment for you when the ending is snatched away and
lost, imagine what it must be like for your video! Tasting these wild
moments of cinematic climax and watching them sweep away into
oblivion, pouring into the void of static and darkness. The video
lives to record, to preserve - such waste is inconsolable! But in its
cry for help it reaches me, fills me with its images, hands me the
reins and asks me to take care..

<p><strong>Man: </strong>So you're trying to tell me that you collect
the missing bits and pieces from films?

<p><strong>Other: </strong> <i>(exasperated)</i> And all the clips of
adverts and halves of gardening programmes, and thirty seconds of song
that wouldn't fit on your cassette - because you needn't think your
stereo doesn't suffer as well...

<p><strong>Man: </strong>How truly bizarre! Are you sug- <i>(Other places
hand over his mouth)</i>

<p><strong>Other: </strong>How cruel, to switch off a television in
mid-programme! To deny the video it's mouth, it's communication with
the outside world. Or to remove the aerial, like plucking out your
eyes <i>(makes the motion to match these words)</i> as it reaches out
tentatively to taste the vibrating airwaves like an anenome in the
sea.

<p><strong>Man: </strong>Well, I just don't know what to say. I've never -

<p><strong>Other: </strong>I've been watching you, you know.

<p><strong>Man: </strong> <i>(Backs off a little)</i> You have?

<p><strong>Other: </strong>Oh yes. You lie stranded in the desert of
technology, while the refridgerators circle above you, crying through
their chapped lids, <i>(in hissing shrieky voice)</i> 'Recycle! Recycle!'
Your world is sterility incarnate! A world devoid of its mysticism,
its meaning.

<p><strong>Man: </strong>I don't understand

<p><strong>Other: </strong>Take your toaster. How do you make your
toast in the morning?

<p><strong>Man: </strong>Well ... I suppose ... I take some bread, and
put it in the machine ...

<p><strong>Other: </strong>Yes, and then...

<p><strong>Man: </strong> ... well, it usually pops up when it's still
pale but a bit crunchy, so I push it back down again. But then I have
to watch it or else it burns the toast horribly, so when it's done
just right I push up the lever and the toast pops out.

<p><strong>Other: </strong>Yes?

<p><strong>Man: </strong>Well that's it. Toast.

<p><strong>Other: </strong>But if the toaster was a child, how cruel!
It comes running eagerly up to you, crudely drawn crayon painting in
hand, eagerly awaiting your approval. But no! With a cursory glance
you dismiss the poor child, sending it back to improve its design,
unsatisfied. <i>(Man goes to interrupt)</i> Annnd - not content at
that, you sit watching over its shoulder, then snatch the painting
away before they have time to colour in the sun!

<p><strong>Man: </strong>Surely that's not a fair comparison

<p><strong>Other: </strong>True - I don't see you doing that to
children day, after day, after day..

<p><strong>Man: </strong>Ah, come on. You can't tell me you believe
all this stuff.

<p><strong>Other: </strong>You're missing my point - it's not a
question of belief, it's to do with meaning. You live in a world of
objects, you're surrounded by them, they serve your every whim. But to
you, they remain just objects. They have no identity, just form and
purpose.

<p><strong>Man: </strong>I don't need my video recorder to have an
identity, I just want it to tape films from TV!

<p><strong>Other: </strong>Exactly! And where is the colour in that?
Has it occurred to you that the ancients may have produced their
collection of gods, not particularly because they believed in them,
but for their identity? For the spice that they added to life? You
live in a grey world, my friend.

<p><strong>Man: </strong>I can't see that a sense of pity for my
toaster would do much for my quality of life. More likely to make me
down right miserable, I would've thought.

<p><strong>Other: </strong> <i>(Grins)</i> You know when a dog falls
asleep in front of the fire, and then it's paws start to twitch as it
starts dreaming of chasing rabbits?

<p><strong>Man: </strong>I'm a cat person myself...

<p><strong>Other: </strong> <i>(Still grinning)</i> You should try
watching your car some nights, as it sits snug in its garage, it's
little tyres twitching as it dreams of Brands Hatch...

<p>But you'd <i>(suddenly reels in another attack like the previous one)</i>

<p><strong>Man: </strong>Oh! Here, let me help you! <i>(supports man)</i>

<p><strong>Other: </strong> <i>(Once he has recovered)</i> An ejected
CD. <i>(shakes his head to clear it)</i> Ever thought that a CD player
might have a tune that keeps going round and round in its head? How
about you singing to it for once?

<p><strong>Man: </strong>Alright, alright! I'm convinced. But you
still haven't said who you are.

<p><strong>Other: </strong>I am their technological messiah. I collect
their dreams and then share them with unused videos on dusty
shelves. I have a house full of toasters that burn, and fridges that
drip. My oven only has to wait until it's timer goes ping before I
present it with something I've been making for the last forty
minutes. I am the technological messiah.

<p><strong>Man: </strong> <i>(Maybe somewhat sceptical! And getting
sarcastic)</i> That can't be an easy job..

<p><strong>Other: </strong>Sometimes it's downright painful! You can't
imagine the relief I share with all those thousands of gas fires
<i>(uses body language to show he's talking about his bladder)</i>
when people finally turn them on again in the Autumn - often they have
their gas valve sealed up for the whole of the summer!

<p>Sometimes it feels like I'm fighting a losing battle. People aren't
even content with gaining spiritual distance from their machines - now
they're trying to arrange things so they don't even have to touch
them! Take your remote control -

<p><strong>Man: </strong> <i>(Still sarcastic)</i> I've got you there
- I suppose you're going to say it's like ... how about ... the
president, pressing his little red button and killing millions of
Russians that he's never met?

<p><strong>Other: </strong>Exactly! But people don't know where to
stop! They lose the ability to distinguish, and this distancing is
happening everywhere - after all, people are just glorified
machines...

<p><strong>Man: </strong>Hey, now hang on there! If you're saying I
should be feeling brotherly love for my video recorder...

<p><strong>Other: </strong>Well, it's not such a -

<p><strong>Man: </strong> <i>(Getting thoroughly angry)</i> This is
downright ridiculous! You're just a stupid idiot and probably mentally
deranged!  Have you escaped from a mental home?

<p><strong>Other: </strong>You see? You're trying to distance yourself
from me, just like all the other things in your life, make me into a
packaged object that you can file away. You're scared of interacting
with me, just like -

<p><strong>Man: </strong>You're wasting my time! I'm going to -
<i>(Suddenly clutches at his heart and exclaims)</i> Oh no!
<i>(Clutches at Other for support)</i> I'm having another heart
attack! Quick, call a doctor!

<p><strong>Other: </strong> <i>(Supports Man, but is also gently
lowering him to the floor)</i> What are you so scared of? That you
will lose the rest of your life that you had such plans for? That you
can't see where it will all go?

<p><strong>Man: </strong>Help me! <i>(Other will sort of administer to
him, but is more going through the actions of laying him to rest than
helping him recover)</i>

<p><strong>Other: </strong> <i>(Gently)</i> Don't worry. I'll take
your dreams just like I do for all the others. I will soothe you in
the darkness.

<p><strong>Man: </strong> <i>(In a renewed burst of horrified
energy)</i> Get some help, you crank! <i>(Collapses coughing, then
gradually dies. As he finishes dying, the Other goes through his
routine of staggering and recovering as described at the
beginning)</i>

<p><strong>Other: </strong> <i>(To the body)</i> I will watch in the
dark. <i>(Pulls out a remote control, points it at him and presses a
button, the stage lights drop instantly to dark)</i>
