<p>Bristol Vampire LRP
<p>
<p>Official Rules of Play
<p>
</h2></center>
<p><b><em>Part 1: Introduction</b></em>
<p>
<p>The Purpose of This Document
<p>This document is to describe all the rules necessary for playing a live Vampire roleplaying game. It includes rules, plus comprehensive information for players and GMs to work from. It is <i>not</i>
 a background document. The information relating to the society of vampires as well as the world as a whole is to be found in the various rulebooks and background works for the original White Wolf Storyteller series, as well as in certain other documents 
circulated within our group.
<p>
<p>The rules laid out here are designed to be as close as possible to the original White Wolf system, altered with the following goals in mind:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
The system must allow resolution of situations as quickly and smoothly as possible.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Provision must be made for the fact that many players will be dressed up, and their location at the time of situation resolution may not be conducive to a lot of dice rolling.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
The results of actions must be relevant and appropriate within the typical time frame of the game being played - typically up to around eight hours (both real time and game time).

<p><b>The Usual Disclaimer
<p></b> In a document for private consumption, this sort of thing shouldnt be necessary, but for those who really feel the need to get up and shout about it 
(especially now our group is expanding rapidly):
<p> Look, its just much easier to write the whole thing using standard masculine pronouns and letting you assume that he means he or she
 and so on. Plenty of women play our games, theres just a bloke writing the text - if you dont like it you should have put in the effort instead of me!
<p>
<p><b>The Sections
<p></b> This booklet is divided into several sections. These are listed below along with the material they should cover:
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Part 1: Introduction.</b>
 General material for brand new players to digest in order to understand what the game is all about.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>
Part 2: Terminology and Character Sheets.</b> A full description of all the system information which a character will have to hand, plus general implications of what this data means.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Part 3: Systems.</b>
 How the actual numbers are used to determine whether or not tasks and actions are achieved. Details of the bookkeeping which needs to be undertaken during play, and why.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Part 4: Guidelines for Players.</b>
 A list of points for players to bear in mind during the game.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Part 5: Guidelines for GMs.</b>
 A list of hints and tips to assist GMs writing and running a game.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Part 6: Organisational Notes.</b>
 A discussion of the logistics of planning a game, and notes on problems previously encountered with suggestions on how to avoid them.
<p><b></b><b>Part 7: Glossary.</b> A complete list of terms encountered in the rules, plus a list of additional terms common in the vampire world.
<p>There may or may not be the following appendices in your copy of the booklet. The appendices conta
in information which most players do not necessarily need to know, and indeed more fun will be had by the players of they are ignorant of the information contained therein. GMs may make use of this material freely, in order to make suitable information av
ailable to the characters which need it, and to spice up their games generally.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Appendix A: Disciplines.</b>
 Contains a full listing of the all the disciplines available to vampires, along with usage notes. This section is formatted such that an electronic copy may be used to cut and paste an individual
s disciplines into his or her background documentation, and contains spaces in which the player may write their relevant traits.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Appendix B: Thaumaturgical Paths.</b>
 Gives a list of the thaumaturgical paths included in the World of Darkness as a whole, including those of lesser known branches of this type of magic.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Appendix C: Thaumaturgical Rituals.</b>
 A comprehensive list from most of the White Wolf publications. Again, formatted such that individual items can be pasted into a players sheets.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Appendix D: Bestiary.</b>
 Contains modifications and additions to the rules for coping with non-vampire characters such as Mages, Werewolves and worse...
<p> 
<p>
<p>What is this Roleplaying?
<p> In its simplest form, roleplaying is lets pretend
 with rules. Several players take on the roles of characters, who exist within an environment described and controlled by a second type of player known as the Game Master, or GM. The players have their characters (each player is usually responsible for 
one character) react and respond to their environs within the framework of the rules and the personalities created for the characters.
<p> 
There are two distinct types of roleplaying game. The first is played in the imaginations of the players, who sit around and describe their actions to each other and the GM. This version allows for almost infinite scope for action (as everything takes pla
ce in the mind), usually deals with extended periods of time, and tends to be limited to about half a dozen players. The s
econd type is Live Action Roleplaying, in which the players actually act the part of their characters. It is this second type of game in which we are interested.
<p>You, as a player, will be assigned a character (person) who exists in the world of the supernatural. It is your job to take on the personality (and looks, if possible) of this entity for the course of one evening (the time during which the game is normall
y played), in a situation created by the GMs of the game. You should attempt to react to the other characters as your characters personality dictates, and attempt to follow their desires and goals. Players are reminded here that <b>
any decision made by the GM is final and not to be argued with</b>.
<p>If you are a GM, you should know enough about the whole thing not to be reading this bit! If you dont, play a few games before getting bogged down in writing one<br> 
<p>The Specifics of Vampire
<p> The Vampire game is written with a specific background and type of character in mind. More than likely, you will be playing
 the part of a vampire, one of the living dead. In their world, vampires are relatively common, although they remain secret from they eyes of mortal man. The <i>Kindred</i>
, as they refer to themselves, live in their own societies, with their own rules and social mores. They are cunning and wily, and invariably locked in their own power struggles and vendettas. You too will play the game with your own motivations and goals,
 and you only have until dawn to see them through<br>  
<p><b>What do I get?
<p></b> In order to fully describe your character, you will be given a significant amount of information:
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>A background sheet.</b>
 This describes the history of your character, from their days as a mortal, through the <i>Embrace</i> (the time at which they were made a vampire), to recent events. It also contains hints about the character
s personality, motivations, goals, appearance, and their opinions on any other characters they may know. All this information might have a bearing on the game, so read it carefully.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>A character sheet.</b> This contains in
formation regarding the abilities of your character, translated into numerical form. This information is fully described
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>A discipline sheet.</b>
 This describes your supernatural vampiric powers, known as <i>disciplines</i>. These are covered in greater depth in parts two and three of this document.
<p> You may also get one or more of the following:
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Props.</b>
 Often, games include certain items. If you begin the game with some item, it will be represented as a prop. Your GM will make an effort to make the prop as realistic as possible.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>General Background Information.</b>
 Contains information your character knows specific to the game in question, but not necessarily part of their personal background. This might include knowledge of some secret society, or general information on the local vampires, or any number of other t
hings.
<p> 
<p>It is in your interests to keep quiet about all the information you have to hand before play begins. It is often the case that you will be privy to certain information or items you do not wish other character
s to have access to initially. You may determine from your background sheets those characters which you trust and communicate with, and it may be permissible or desirable to talk to them before starting, but the golden rule is if in doubt, don
t tell anybody. If you really want to discuss certain points, and you are unsure of the consequences, find and ask the GM of your game for advice.
<p>
<p><b><em>Part 2: Terminology and Character Sheets
<p></b></em> 
<p> 
<p>What do all these dots mean?
<p>Is has all been fairly easy until now, howeve
r things are just about to start getting more complex (sorry!). Because players are not being themselves, but playing the parts of often completely different beings, there must be a way of describing their characters
 abilities. Most of a characters defin
ing factors, other than esoteric features like personality, can be boiled down to a set of numbers. This section endeavours to introduce you to these numbers, describe what they represent, and explain why they are needed (Part three will explain how the n
umbers are actually used). You will probably find it helpful to have a character sheet to hand when reading this section.
<p>
<p> Personal Information
<p> 
The personal information on your sheet is largely textual. The consequences of most of this information are determined by the other characters in the game and by the world background.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Name.</b>
 The name of your character. If the character works under a pseudonym, that might be reflected here, or it might not, so check your background sheets before mentioning it.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Player.</b> T
his should be your name. If it isnt, you might have the wrong sheet! Take it to a GM, (without reading it) before play!
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Race.</b>
 For nearly all players, this will read vampire or Kindred, marking you as the living dead!
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Generation.</b> <i>Generation</i>
 is a number. According to the vampire legend, all vampires are descended from Caine (as in Abel), who became the first as a result of his curse from God. Your generation is how far removed you are from this ancestor, so Caine is 1
st generation, those vampires he created are 2nd, their children are 3rd
 and so on. Your generation determines how potent your blood is, and has certain knock-on effects throughout the game - remember that a <i>lower</i> number for generation indicates a <i>more</i> powerful vampire. Most average
 vampires are between 10th and 14th generation.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Clan.</b> The Kindred are split into 
<i>clans</i>, determined by their ancestry and usually traced back to those of the third generation. These clans tend to have stereotypical membership, outlooks, goals and attitudes
. Look at the background documentation to determine the significant details of your clan, how it perceives the other clans, and how they view it.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Concept.</b>
 This is a short phrase indicating how the GMs see your character during the game.
<p> 
<p>Attributes
<p> <i>I am not a number, I am a free man!
<p>- Number 6, The Prisoner
<p></i>Your attributes describe the basic physical and mental parameters of your character. They are represented as a series of dots on your sheet. These dots translate directly into numbers - if you have t
wo dots filled in next your strength attribute, you have a strength of two. Note that the human range, as well as that for all but the most powerful vampirism, of these values is from one to five. The average level for both humans and Kindred is <b>two</b>
.
<p> 
<p><b>Physical Attributes
<p></b> 
These values represent the prowess of your body. Vampires can temporarily boost these values to higher levels, which is one of the things that makes them more powerful than humans. Such activity is described in section three (under Blood Points).
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Strength.</b>
 A measure of raw physical strength, as well as your ability to apply it effectively. Strength is sometimes abbreviated Str.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Dexterity.</b>
 Represents all aspects of body control, from manual dexterity through to overall agility and physical reflexes. Dexterity is sometimes abbreviated Dex.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Stamina.</b>
 A measure of your general health and how much punishment you can take, both in terms of both exercise and physical damage. Stamina is sometimes abbreviated Sta.
<p> 
<p> <b>Social Attributes
<p></b> Much of vampi
re interplay is resolved in social situations. How well you interact with the others of your kind is described by these numbers. These values come into play far less than the physical ones, as most of the situations they cover are actually acted out by yo
u, the player, rather than being used for any rules based activity.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Charisma.</b>
 A sum of bearing and charm, this is how likeable you are. Charisma may be abbreviated Cha.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Manipulation.</b>
 Your innate ability to persuade and influence others views and actions. Abbreviated Man.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Appearance.</b>
 A measure of raw physical appearance - how good looking you are. Occasionally abbreviated as App.
<p> 
<p> <b>Mental Attributes</b><b>
<p></b> 
These attributes describe the overall ability of your mind. Like social attributes, these are rarely used during the game, as the abilities they represent are usually substituted by the players own powers of reasoning.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Perception.</b>
 This is your awareness of your surroundings, your intuitive ability to notice what is happening around you. This can be applies across a spectrum of situations, from noticing a physical ambush to determining the underlying meaning in  a politician
s speech. Can be abbreviated Per.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Intelligence.</b>
 This is raw reasoning power - a combination of memory and deductive ability. Abbreviated Int.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Wits.</b>
 Describes how quickly your mind reacts to things. In essence, whilst intelligence determines the quality of your decisions, wits shows how fast you reach them in times of stress.
<p> 
<p> Abilities
<p> Whist your attributes give an outline of what you a
re, your abilities form the bulk of what you know. These values represent your knowledge, experience and training. Abilities are not usually used directly, but are applied to certain situations in combination with other values, usually an associated attri
bute. They are organised into three subsections, which have a minor effect on their use (see part three). Like attributes, abilities are denoted as a number, written as filled in dots next to the name of the ability in question - the more dots you have, t
he better you are at performing actions requiring said ability.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Talents.</b> Describes a character
s natural and intuitive abilities. This sort of thing is best learned through actual experience. As everyone has a basic natural aptitude for talents, rolls which include a talent which the character does not possess are treated as 
if the value was zero.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Skills.</b>
 These require more in the way of training than talents, and tend to represent more complex functions which require elements of both physical skill and appli
cation of knowledge. These are more difficult to perform without some level of training - characters who are required to roll on skills they dont have treat the effective value as -1.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Knowledges.</b>
 These are generally the product of book learning, almost entirely representing bodies of informational knowledge with little physical component. Characters may not attempt rolls requiring the use of knowledges they don
t have - they simply fail automatically.
<p> 
<p> Derived Statistics
<p> As described in part three, often
 when you want to achieve an action you will be required to roll dice to determine whether or not you succeed. You will need to apply a number to this roll, to factor in how good you are at the action in question - that number will usually be found in thi
s section. The values here are mostly combinations of attributes and abilities which, for ease of play, have been worked out for you in advance of the game. For example, your dodge
 value here is a combination of your Dodge talent and your Dexterity attribute. Specific items pre-entered in the derived section are:
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Initiative.</b>
 This is a measure of how quickly you react to your circumstances.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Dodge.</b>
 This is you skill at avoiding strikes, both unarmed and with weapons.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Resist Damage.</b>
 This is used whenever someone tries to hurt you.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Attacks.</b>
 There are several attack headings, which normally include two numbers. You use the <i>To Hit</i> number when attempting to use the attack type on someone, and the <i>Damage</i>
 number to see how badly you hurt them if you succeed in hitting.
<p> The exact use of these items is described in part three.
<p> 
<p> Other Information
<p> The bottom portion of the character sheet contains a variety of miscellaneous information regarding your character.
<p> 
<p> <b>Disciplines
<p></b> 
Due to their supernatural nature, vampires may develop special powers similar to magical effects. These powers are known as disciplines, and you will probably have a few. Each discipline has several levels, as the level increases, so the power of the effe
cts which can be achieved rises. The actual 
powers that can be learnt include (but are by no means limited to) ESP, the ability to subvert others to your will, supernatural strength or stamina, and shapeshifting powers. The information on your sheet is merely a reference to which disciplines you ha
ve and to that level - a description of what you can actually achieve using your disciplines as well as how to use them will be given to you in a specialised document which you should receive along with your character sheet and background information.

<p> 
<p> <b>Willpower
<p></b> 
At the fundamental level, this is a measure of your strength of will (no surprises there). The number here is a value from one to ten, but it is noted in an unusual fashion. When needed, you will be required to use your current number of willpower points 
(often abbreviated WP) as a value when rolling for certain actions. This number may drop during the course of the game, and for this reason your willpower is noted as a number of squares, which may be crossed off as the level are reduced. The maximum 
level you can attain is noted by the fact that any higher boxes will be inked in or otherwise permanently shaded. Lower boxes will be either blank (indicating that you have a point) or crossed out (indicating that a point has been removed). When asked to 
use your willpower for a roll, the number you require is therefore the number of <i>white</i> boxes remaining on your sheet.
<p> 
<p> <b>Blood Pool
<p></b> Most creatures contain an amount of blood, and vampires are no exception. The difference (other than the fact that the blood in vampires tends to be someone else
s) is that the undead need to consume this blood to survive and can burn the blood contained in their bodies to produce certain effects such as boosting their strength or healing wounds (as described in part three). Fo
r convenience, the blood in a being is split down into standard Blood Points (BP) for measurement. As with willpower, each vampire has a maximum amount of blood that he or she can contain (in this case the figure is dependent on your generation), and this
 l
imit is noted in the same way - by permanently shading any boxes higher than the maximum level. The other boxes can be blank on crossed off, again just like willpower. Unlike willpower, the total number of blood points you have is rarely referred to withi
n the game (unless you get very low), but the actual number you have is likely to change often as you use (very common) and drink (rare during a game) the stuff.
<p> 
<p> A second consideration is that a vampires generation limits the amount of blood which can be u
sed to create special effects. This is also noted as a rate - your sheet will say how many BP you are allowed to spend in any ten second period. For most vampires this will be a lowly one, but elders are far more dangerous<br>  
<p> <b>Virtues
<p></b> You will have three virtues on your sheet, which are measured at levels from one to five. For the majority of kindred, these virtues are as follows:
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Conscience.</b>
 This represents how likely the character is to feel remorse at an act deemed morally wrong by his code of ethics.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Courage.</b>
 A raw measure of general bravery. This is used in particular when vampires encounter one of the things they most fear - fire.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Self Control.</b>
 In addition to general self discipline, this represents how good the character is at controlling the Beast within, a recurring theme in vampire games. Vampires are much closer to the primeval beast than humans, and as a result occasionally fly into frenz
ies at moments of stress. The less self control they have, the more likely it is that this will happen.
<p> Certain
 undead have significantly different outlooks and ways of living, and may have completely different sets of virtues. The most common alternate set is applied to members of the Sabbat:
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Callousness.</b>
 How capable the character is of overriding his or her sense of ethics and morals, in order to perform evil deeds.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Instincts.</b>
 Instead of suppressing the Beast, the Sabbat prefer to ride the wave. This is a measure of how much control they retain when the Beast takes over.
<p><b></b><b>Morale.</b> Similar to courage (and should be used when called upon to make a Courage based roll). Most applicable as group morale, when the character
s associates are also involved.
<p>Virtues are rarely used in the game, but you may occasionally be called upon to use them for certain rolls.
<p>
<p><b>Humanity/Path
<p></b>This is a measure of various factors, lumped into one number. Humanity is a combination of:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Morality - the character
s adherence to the common good viewpoint of society in general. To an extent, how law abiding the character is.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>How far from the Bea
st the character has managed to pull himself. The more human you are, the more the Beast is suppressed.
<p> A character with a high humanity will be able to stay awake during daylight hours more easily (as long as they aren
t actually exposed to sunlight!), and if ever driven into torpor (a coma-like state) by damage will come around more quickly than one who has degenerated.
<p> As with virtues, many Kindred follow a completely alien set of morals and ethics, so different that they cannot be judged on their closen
ess to humanity. These alternate codes of living are called Paths (or Paths of Enlightenment), and there are many in existence. The character gets a Path rating just as they would with Humanity, and it is used in much the same way. The basic difference is
 that players with path based characters will need to review the ethics of the path so that they can play their characters properly.
<p> 
<p> <b>Health Levels
<p></b> It is an unfortunate fact of LRP games that your character often ends up getting hurt for some reason or othe
r, however for a vampire the outlook is far less bleak than for a normal human as the Kindred can heal most damage rapidly. Your health chart gives two columns, marked Overall and Aggravated
. Hopefully, you will start the game with one tick in the OK box above the columns, indicating that you have no injuries. Every time you sustain some damage, the levels are marked off the Overall column (top down).
<p> The wounds caused by some types of attack are particularly damaging to a vampire, and cannot be healed quickly. Injuries of this type are referred to as <i>
aggravated damage</i>, and should be recorded in their own column as well as the Overall
 section. Sources of aggravated damage include (but certainly are not limited to) vampire bites, fire, sunlight and the claws of werewolves and other supernatural creatures.
<p> 
Non-aggravated damage is healed by spending blood points. Characters in wounded conditions must make detrimental modifications to their chances of success when attempting actions. This is noted in the
 modifiers column. All the factors mentioned in this section are described more fully in part three.
<p> 
<p><b><em>Part 3: Systems
<p></b></em> 
<p> 
<p>How to Accomplish Goals
<p> There are certain guidelines regarding what you can and cannot attempt and achieve within the system.
<p> 
<p> <b>What You Can and Cannot Do</b>
<p> 
As a general rule, when you are playing a character, anything you can do, so can they. All social interaction and most physical activity should be played out - you should really do the tasks in question. There are a few exceptions:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>If yo
u (the player) have specialised knowledge that your character does not, you should not use this during the game. You can check your character sheet to see if your character has any abilities which would correspond to the knowledge you intend to use. Good 
examples within the group of this sort of skill are: Computer knowledge, martial arts, picking locks and an extensive knowledge of military history (regulars are invited to speculate which of those examples pertain to which players).
<p><b></b>* <b></b>If your action would re
sult in damage to either the premises, someone
s possessions, or another player, it should be simulated! This includes breaking down doors, smashing furniture to toothpicks (or more appropriate pointy wooden implements), punching the person standing next 
to you to the floor, and sticking a wooden stake through your friend<br> <b></b>* <b></b>
If your character can perform an action which you personally cannot, this should also be simulated. These include use of vampiric disciplines, and any skill which you dont have.
<p> In order to resolve actions which you cannot/should not actually perform, you have to resort to<br>  
<p> <b>Rolling Dice
<p></b> 
Obviously, you cannot always succeed in every task you attempt. If you really are trying the action, then you succeed or fail on your own merits. If, however, you are rolling for one of the reasons given above, your character
s skills and background come into play. Rolls are made using a ten sided die (often referred to as a D10), which are often marked 0-9. In all circumstances, zero is read as ten.
<p> 
<p> There are two types of rolls which can be made.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><i>Passive rolls</i> (also known as <i>
static rolls</i>) are made when the task at hand is acting on a passive object rather than another character. Examples include picking locks, attempting to break objects and trying to leap over tall obstacles (in a single bound).
<p><b></b>* <b></b><i>Opposed rolls</i> (also known as <i>
contested rolls</i>) are made when the action is being performed on another person, who is resisting. Examples of this sort of roll are attempting to strike someone (who will try to dodge)
 and use of vampiric mind subjugating powers, the victim of which will certainly attempt to resist.
<p>
<p>
Passive rolls are resolved as follows: roll a ten-sided dice (D10), and modify it by adding your appropriate skill level (usually found in the derived statistics section, though this number could be based on other statistics on your sheet, such as Willpow
er) and subtracting any modifiers for your current state of health (see health, below). The result is compared with a <i>difficulty number</i>. If you get less than or equal to the target number, you have failed. If you get <b>more</b>
 than the difficulty, you succeed. If you succeed, your actual degree of success is calculated from the number by which you beat the difficulty. This derived number is termed your <i>number of successes</i>
, and the more you get, the more completely you have accomplished your desired action. The concept of successes is described more fully below. If you fail to perform an action of this type, you may not attempt the same thing again during the game w
ithout first consulting a GM.
<p>
<p><b><i>Example:</b></i><i> Horace wishes to pick a doors lock to gain access to his sire
s haven (dangerous stuff). The haven is reasonably secure, and the GM determines that the difficulty number of the lock is 10. Horaces pick locks skill modifier is 4. He rolls 6, which added
 to four comes to ten. This is not greater than the difficulty, so after some minutes of grappling with its intricacies, Horace fails to open the lock. As this lock has defeated him, Horace may not try to pick it again
 for the remainder of the game, however he is free to try his hand at any other lock he encounters.
<p></i><i>Horace
s accomplice, Paula, has an impressive pick locks skill of 7. Once Horace has finished messing about she turns her professional eye to the problem. Rolling a 9, her total of 16 is significantly greater than the required 11. With cool confidence, Pa
ula opens the door and our duo slip inside<br> </i>
<p>An opposed roll is only slightly more complicated than a passive one. This time, both the involved parties roll 
a dice, and once again add the appropriate skill level and subtract any current health modifiers. The person who initiated the roll (e.g. the person who threw the punch) is referred to as the attacker and the target of the action (e.g. the person who is a
ttempting to dodge) is referred to as the defender. In order to succeed in his action, the attackers total must be <b>higher</b> than the defenders. Once the roll has been  made, if necessary the amount by which the winner
s total exceeded the losers will be converted to a degree of success as described below.
<p>
<p><b><i>Example:</b></i><i>
 The dastardly Hamish McNasty is attempting to use his Dominate discipline to bend square-jawed Felix to his will. Hamish rolls 6, and adds his skill of 4 for a total of 10. Felix adds his 8 willpower to his roll of 2, equalling Hamish. As Hamish was the 
aggressor, he loses ties, and Felix emerges unscathed.
<p></i><i>Felix now decides that it is in his idiom to punch McNasty to the floor in a manly fashion. He rolls 9 plus his punch of 6, yielding a total o
f 15. Hamish tries to dodge, rolling 5 and adding his Dodge skill (5) for a total of 10. As this is well below Felixs punch, Hamish takes a blow to the jaw.
<p></i>
<p>
Certain opposed rolls are deemed as having no initiating party. In this instance, tied rolls are considered to indicate that both parties have failed in their objective. They are deadlocked and both may roll again. Under normal circumstances the new roll 
is made straight away, however this may be affected by a combat situation (see Time and Actions under Combat, below).
<p>
<p><b><i>Example:</b></i><i>
 Boris and Sam are two rather crazed Brujah, fighting over possession of the Mighty Sword of Dobar. Both already have a good grip on the item, and are trying to wrench it free of the other. They make an opposed roll, both adding their strength attribute. 
Boris rolls 5, and adds his Strength of 4 for a total of 9. Sam has a lower strength, 3, but rolls a 6 for an identical total. Our Brujah have spent a few seconds wrestling over the Sword, but are still deadlocked.
<p></i>
<p><b>Rolling a One
<p></b>
Rolling a one on the dice (before any skill levels or modifiers are added or subtracted) is a special occasion, as it denotes an unmitigated failure to achieve whatever it was you wanted to do. This effect occurs regardless of the total when skill bonuses
 are added. A roll of one is sometimes referred to as a <i>botch</i>.
<p>
<p><b><i>Optional Rule:</b></i><i> On a die result of one, the person rolling may experience some kind of embarrassing, abject, and perhaps dangerous failure, rather than simply missing the total and failing in 
their goal. Examples of these special results are shown below This suggestion is entirely optional, and may be implemented by the GMs and players of a specific game in several ways:
<p><i>1.</i></i>* .<i>Do not use it at all.
<p><i>2.</i></i>* .<i>
Only use it if a GM sees a roll of one happen, and can impose a special result on the spot.
<p><i>3.</i></i>* .<i>
As 2, but also allow players to reach a consensus on a special result should no GM be present. This option should be limited to more experienced players, who are asked to steer clear of the totally absurd!
<p></i>
<p>Depending on the type of roll being made, the results of rolling a one are as follows:
<p>-108 <b>Roll Type</b>
<b>Attacker Rolls</b><b>Defender Rolls</b><b>Result</b>
<b></b>-108 
Passive1-Automatic failure, possible special result.
Opposed1Over 1
Attack fails, possible special result for attacker. Assume five successes for defender if required.
OpposedOver 11
Attack succeeds. If successes required, award 5 to attacker, else apply special result to defender.-108 
Opposed11
Attack fails, possible disaster for <i>both</i> parties!
<p>NB: There is one exception to
 this rule of one - damage resistance rolls treat a one just like any other result, the total being added up and applied to the situation. This is further explained in the combat section.
<p>
<p><b><i>Example:</b></i><i> Not put off by his last failure, Horace has a go at opening the locked chest he finds under his sire
s bed. The lock is small and simple, and the GM ascribes it a difficulty of 6. Unfortunately, Horace rolls a one on his D10, a serious failure. The GM decides that Horaces clumsy effort has broken off his picking
 tool inside the mechanism and jammed it for good. Not only will he not be able to open the case, but Paula will be unable to try, and worse, when its owner tries to access it he will know that someone has been tampering<br> </i>
<p><b><i>Example:</b></i><i>
 Jackie is sitting in a bar, when a passing fat Greek singer (Demis) knocks over his pint by brushing against it with his kaftan. Jackie assumes that Demis is a stuntman of some kind, and immediately launches a cinematically appropriate leaping spinning k
ick over his table. Jackie has a kick skill of 8, and is still rolling against Demiss poor Dodge of 2. Unfortunately, Jackie rolls a 1 against Demis
s 6. Even though the totals are 9 for Jackie and 8 for Demis, that 1 means Jackie has screwed up royally. The GM rules thus - as Ja
ckie launches his kick, he slips on the spilled pint, misses, and lands on a group of other (now enraged) customers. As a mighty bar brawl erupts around him, Demis slips quietly away<br> </i>
<p><b>Successes
<p></b>As mentioned above, many rolls are translated into a number of
 successes, representing how well the goal in question was accomplished. The number of successes you get may range from one (marginal), through three (accomplished you goal as desired), to five (outstanding, you achieved more than you hoped for).
<p>
<p>The number of successes achieved from a roll is determined as follows:
<p>-107 
Number by which roll total exceeds difficulty*:1-34-5
6-789+
-107 
Number of successes gained:123
45
<p>*For opposed rolls, this is the amount by which the winning roll exceeded the losing ro
ll. If an opposed roll is tied, the attacker has failed (as noted above), but neither side actually achieves any successes.
<p>
<p>
Most actions which require successes to be taken into account are specifically described in this document - the actual result of each level of accomplishment is noted, however it is impossible to gauge the diverse actions which may be attempted during a g
ame. As an example of how successes can be used, we look at that old favourite, picking locks. In this instance, the most easily affected factor is that of time, so increased success will decrease the time necessary to finish the action:
<p>
<p>-108 <b>Successes</b><b>Result</b>
<b></b>-108 Roll of 1
Disaster! You may have only taken a second to do it (GMs whim), but you have really botched. Perhaps you have broken the lock, or cut yourself and left traces of blood.
0 (Fail)Lock defeats you for tonight. It took you several minutes of trying to find this out.
1Lock complies after several minutes of obvious fiddling.
2A minute is enough to gain entry. Dont get spotted!
3Half a minute used, but youll look mighty suspicious if caught out.
4
A brief fiddle fixes the problem. An observer at a distance might register that you had difficulty with your key, but would be unlikely to suspect foul play.-108 
5Instant - even quite a close observer would assume you had just used the key.

<p>From the table given above, it should be relatively easy to extrapolate the results of successes for other actions.
<p>
<p>Time and Actions, and the Cardinal Rule<b>
<p></b>Virtually the whole game is played in real time, and the GMs will endeavour to avoid having to call time outs
 to resolve situation. This means that anything you do will require a suitable amount of time to perform. For example, if you are attempting to pick a complex lock, then you will
 only spend a few seconds rolling the dice, but the attempt could take a few minutes (as described in successes
 above). In this sort of case you should spend a minute or two fiddling with the lock in question so that the appropriate amount of time is used (during which time, someone might run across youin doubt, ask a GM. 
<p>
<p>
On some occasions, this real time flow is insufficient to cope with complicated actions (such as multiple people in combat). In this case, time will be broken down into chunks representing ten seconds or thereabouts, called turns or rounds. These are deal
t with in greater detail in the portions of this chapter devoted to combat.
<p>
<p>In order to ensure the game flows smoothly, and that everyone knows what is going on, the following ruling is paramount:
<p>
<p>Assuming your character had the wherewithal to perform it in the first place, any action you undertake really is accomplished or attempted, regardless of the result or potential consequences. Or,<b>
 once you do something, it is done.</b>
<p>
<p>The following is <b>not</b> a defence: <i>Oh, but even though </i>I<i> (the player) didnt know what the consequences of doing that would be, </i>my character<i> would, so actually I didn
t do that.
<p></i>Yes, you did. No action can be taken back once it is set in motion. Even if you spi
t in the eye of the Prince and he calls for your immediate execution. It is the responsibility of the player to have a reasonable grasp of the vampire background, particularly those portions which are of relevance to their character. The attempted taking 
back of actions usually stems from a player not thinking before they act, and from not reading their background carefully enough.
<p>New players are encouraged to ask questions without prejudice <i>before</i> they act, but the more experienced are requested to keep this activity to a minimum, again to facilitate game flow.
<p>
<p><b>Celerity
<p></b>The Celerity discipline is something that all players should be aware of, as it affects the flow of play. At any time, a character may announce Celerity
 followed by a number. When this happens, all other players should freeze for 3 seconds for every lev
el announced by the calling player. Other characters with the discipline may also announce its use, giving them free action to match the original user. Celerity also affects combat - see th
e appropriate section. A more detailed description of this power is available to characters who possess the discipline - check your disciplines sheet.
<p>
<p><b><i>Example:</b></i><i> Blake looks up the stairs to see a renegade Nosferatu pointing a gun at him. He announces Celerity 1
, giving him three seconds of free action to escape before the Nosferatu can react.
<p></i><i>
<p></i><b><i>Example:</b></i><i> Stephan is attempting to run away from an enraged Lyn. He announces Celerity 2, expecting it to give him six free seconds to get a head start. Unfortunat
ely, Lyn also has the discipline and counters - Celerity 2 - giving both characters an even break.
<p></i><i>
<p></i><b><i>Example:</b></i><i>
 Joe, Max, Aaron and Robert are having an argument over a variety of artistic artefacts which threatens to erupt into violence. Each thinking they may be able to get away with some bits and pieces before the others, they start to announce Celerity use. Ma
x is first to try, calling Celerity 2. Aaron decides that although his Celerity is less powerful he will at least reduce Maxs head start, and uses Celerity 1
. Robert is more advanced, and unwilling to let the matter drop uses his power Celerity 3.
<p></i><i>
So, Robert gets three seconds of free action whilst the others are frozen. For the next three seconds, He and Max may both act. After that, the next three seconds can be used by Aaron, Max and Robert. Finally, those without Celerity (including poor Joe) u
nfreeze and time continues as normal.
<p></i>
<p>Blood
<p>As mentioned previously, vampires can put the blood they drink to various uses, as well as actually usin
g it to stay alive. Most normal humans, and vampires, contain ten blood points. Vampires of lower generations may contain more, which makes them significantly more dangerous to tackle.
<p>
<p><b>Spending Blood</b>
<p>
Blood may be spent on a variety of things. When it is spent it is gone forever (until you next drink some more), and should immediately be crossed off your character sheet (cross through the white boxes in your blood pool section). The uses of blood are:

<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Staying alive.</b>
 Every Kindred must spend one blood point a night - it is this blood which keeps the undead alive
. Unless otherwise stated, it is assumed that you have already spent this point before the game begins and are therefore not required to cross it off during play.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Raising physical attributes.</b>
 You may temporarily add points to your physical attributes (strength, dexterity, stamina) through the use of blood. For every blood point you cross off, one attribute may be raised by one point for five minutes. After the five minutes is up, the addition
al point 
disappears. You may boost these attributes as much as you like subject to the amount of blood you have, the number of points you can spend in ten seconds and a maximum level determined by your generation. Most Kindred have a maximum limit of five in any a
ttribute, although this may be higher for elders of low generation; note that this maximum is applied to the original attribute <i>plus</i> temporary additions - if you have a stamina of five already, you cannot boost it at all.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Healing damage.</b> Blood can be used t
o heal normal damage, at the rate of one health level per blood point spent. Healing requires concentration, and can only be undertaken during a turn (10 seconds) in which the vampire does nothing - you may not be engaged in combat or other strenuous (eit
her mentally or physically) activity. Only normal damage can be healed in this way. Aggravated damage is also healed with blood, but the timescale and cost of this healing are outside the scope of an evenings play.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Absorbing damage.</b>
 If a vampire is already severely wounded, additional non-aggravated damage is applied directly to the blood pool, removing one blood point per health level suffered. This loss of blood is involuntary. See Health.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Giving it to others.</b>
 You may wish to help allies who have low blood pools by feeding them some of yours. This can be achieved by opening a vein or artery and letting them drink from you. See the sections on drinking blood and the Blood Bond below.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Miscellaneous uses.</b>
 There are a variety of vampiric disciplines and other o
ne-off or rare circumstances which require the use of blood points. These will be detailed under the discipline description, or explained to you be the GM or in your background documents - whatever is appropriate.
<p> 
<p> 
No matter what you wish to spend blood on, you may never spend it faster than the limit for your generation. That means that an average vampire can only spend one point every ten seconds.
<p> 
<p> <b><i>Example:</b></i><i> Pete has physical attributes as follows: Strength 3, Dexterity 2, Stamina 4, and wishes to raise th
ese all to their maximum levels as he is about to challenge Joe the Sabbat to a duel (without telling him). As he is 10</i><i>th</i><i>
 generation, he has a blood pool of 13, can spend only one BP every ten seconds, and has a maximum attribute level of five. He needs to spend 6 points to get all his attributes to five, which will take him one minute (60 seconds = 6 points x 10 seconds) b
efore he can wade in. At the boosted stats last five minutes, this delay means that they will start to drop again four minutes after he began the boosting process.
<p></i> 
<p> 
If your blood level reaches a low level (three or less points), you will be prone to frenzy at the sight or smell of blood. Should you reach this condition, inform a GM so that they can take this information into account. In the unlikely event that you re
ach zero blood points, you enter a state called <i>Torpor</i>, which is described in the Health section.
<p> 
<p> <b>Gaining/Drinking Blood
<p></b> If course, what really makes vampires vampires is the fact that they drink blood. The drinking of blood re
quires that the vampire first bite the victim, or at least has the chance to place his mouth at an already existing and suitable wound (e.g. an opened vein). When the bite is on, the following round the vampire can begin drinking, taking on blood at the r
ate of one point every ten seconds. Of course, the victim will be losing blood at the same rate. When drinking blood, you can <i>never</i>
 exceed your maximum blood pool. If you are deliberately trying to drain a victim to death, but they have more blood points than you have space, you must use your blood up to make room, or spend alternate rounds draining blood and spitting it out.
<p> Drinking from other vampires deserves special mention. It is possible for a vampire to actually drain another
s life force, permanently destroying the victim, in a process known as <i>diablerie</i>
. Once the victim has been drained of blood, the drinker may attempt to continue to drink, now sucking at the vital energy of the target. Every round, the drinker must roll their strength against a di
fficulty of nine. Every success they achieve drains the target of one health level (see health, below). Once the last health level has been removed (the target has dropped below incapacitated), the victim dies the final death, his life force consumed by t
he diablerist.
<p> 
Why would people do such a thing, when there are many easier ways to dispatch a foe? The answer is for personal gain; should the victim of diablerie be of a lower generation than the drinker, then the drinkers own generation will lower by on
e (with all the attendant benefits) - it is for this reason that the <i>Camarilla</i> generally bans diablerie, and why many elders seek to bind their <i>neonates</i>
 and keep other young vampires under control. As a general rule, those engaging in such practice may well end up in serious (life threatening) trouble with the local Kindred authorities.
<p> 
It is possible for more than one person to drink from a target simultaneously. In this instance, each drinker may get one blood point per round from the victim (who is obvio
usly in dire trouble). If diablerie is being attempted, the person to drain the last health level (from incapacitated to dead) from the victim gains the generation drop, although it is possible that more than one may benefit in this way if the victim was 
more than three generations below that of the lowest generation drinker.
<p> 
<p> <b>The Bite
<p></b> 
The bite of a vampire may take place in one of two circumstances. In general use on humans, the Kindred will either persuade or Dominate the victim into submission, or will h
ave such a good hold as to be able to bite with relative care. Such Vampire bites which have been inflicted with the purpose of drinking blood are usually fairly small, and can be closed without a trace by the vampire which caused them with a lick of the 
tongue on the affected area.
<p> 
The bite is also a potent combat weapon, causing aggravated damage, although it requires that the user first grapples their opponent in order to get close enough to sink the teeth in (see Grappling, in the Combat section). A bit
e used in this more violent way can also be used to drink blood, the drain again commencing on the turn following the actual bite at the rate of one blood point every ten seconds. Such a bite cannot be closed by licking.
<p> 
<p> <b>The Blood Bond
<p></b> 
One of the more sinister aspects of vampire blood is the power it grants over others who drink it. Someone who drinks from the same vampire on three separate occasions will become the vampires <i>Thrall</i>
. The thrall becomes an emotional slave to his new master (known as the <i>Regnant</i>), and experiences a feeling akin to total love for him or her. This will cause the thrall to consistently act in the regnant
s best interests, unable to plot, let alone act against him. The thrall will be only too willing to do favours and so on, althoug
h even the blood bond will not cause the poor victim to perform potentially suicidal acts. Note that it is possible to hate your regnant with a vengeance, but still be unable to act against him.
<p> There are restrictions placed on the bond. Firstly, after 
a very long time (particularly if the thrall can actually be away from the regnant for that time) the power of the bond <i>may</i> fade. Secondly, a thrall <i>cannot</i>
 be bound to anybody else whilst a previous bond lasts, regardless of the powers of the prospective regnant. 
<p> 
<p> Health
<p> Lets face it, sooner or later you
re going to get hurt. This section tells you how to cope with taking and healing damage, as well as what happens to you when you are in an injured state.
<p> 
<p> <b>Taking Damage
<p></b> Every vampire has a number of health levels, denoting their state at any given time. These are OK, Bruised, Hurt, 
Injured, Wounded, Mauled, Crippled and Incapacitated. Most people will start the game at OK. When you suffer damage, you will drop a certain number of health lev
els, denoted by crossing or ticking the boxes in the Overall damage column on your character sheet. For example, if you are OK
, and lose three levels of damage, you will tick the next three boxes - the last one denoting that you are now Injured.
<p> If a hapless vampire continues to suffer damage after they have reached the incapacitated state, these additional levels are removed directly from the vampire
s blood points, one a one point per health level suffered basis. If the victim also runs out of blood points, they enter <i>torpor</i> (see below).
<p> 
<p> <b>Aggravated Damage</b>
<p> 
As mentioned before, certain types of damage are very difficult for a vampire to heal, and are referred to as aggravated damage. Such damage must obviously be recorded separately, as it provides a l
imit beyond which a vampire cannot heal. The following is a good list of the sources of aggravated damage, though it is not exhaustive:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Fire
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Sunlight
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Vampire Bites
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Vampires using the Wolf
s Claws of the Protean discipline.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Certain other attacks from vampiric disciplines.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
The claws and teeth of most supernatural creatures (e.g. Werewolves, Demons etc.)
<p> 
<p> When a character suffers one or more levels of aggravated damage, he adds these points to both the Overall
 column on his health record, as well as the Aggravated column. Both of these columns are filled from the top available slot, so if the vampire has suffered any normal damage before the aggravated hit, the Aggravated
 column will still read as less injured than the Overall column.
<p> Should a vampire receive <i>any</i> aggravated damage when in the Incapacitated <b>overall</b>
 state (or if a less injured character takes enough aggravated damage levels at once to take them past incapacitated on the <b>overall</b> column), he or she suffers Final Death, forever gone. Note t
hat this still happens even if all previous damage has been non-aggravated - the reference point is the vampires <i>Overall</i> health level.
<p> 
<p> <b>Results of Damage
<p></b> 
If you are in an injured state, the pain and damage to your body will hamper your actions. If you attempt any action which requires a roll whilst you are injured, you must apply a modifier representing the extra difficulty you face. This modifier can be f
ound on the character sheet health record, and should be read from the line of your current overall health level. For example, if you have suffered four levels of damage, taking you to wounded, you must subtract 2 from <i>all</i>
 your rolls unless and until the damage is healed.
<p> 
<p> 
If a vampire suffers final death, his or her body will revert to the form it would be in, had the character actually died when they were embraced. In other words, a neonate embraced in the past few weeks would become grey and probably rather evil smelling
, but an elder embraced hundreds of years ago would become a desiccated husk or perhaps even crumble to dust.
<p> 
<p> <b>Healing Damage</b>
<p> 
Non-aggravated damage can be healed easily by the Kindred, merely by spending blood points. For every blood point spent, the overall health level can be raised by one, as long as it goes no higher than the aggravated health level. In order to use blood to
 heal damage, the vampire must not be engaged in any other actions - he or she must be still and concentrating on the task of healing. Remember that no more blood can be spent in one round than the maximum for your generation.
<p> Aggravated damage cannot be healed during the course of play, as it takes much longer to repair.
<p> 
<p> <b><i>Example:</b></i><i> Eric is out hunting when he happens upon stragglers from a student demonstration
. He waylays one, and is about to munch on his victim when the plucky chap belts Eric with a spanner. This strike does two levels of damage, so Eric crosses off two levels of overall damage, leaving him at Hurt
. He attempts to grab his assailant and manages, despite the -1 modifier he has for his injury, to get a good hold. Unfortunately, one of the victim
s friends notices the struggle, and throws his petrol bomb, aiming near enough to frighten Eric without actually catching them in the flames. Of course, petrol bombs are not known for their aerodynamic ac
curacy, and the throw is close enough to splash our hapless Kindred. Eric releases the victim, and rolls along the floor to put out his clothing. By now he has sustained a further three levels of damage, this time aggravated because it was caused by fire.

<p></i> <i>Eric now crosses off these three health levels from the overall column, taking him down to Mauled, </i><b><i>and</b></i><i>
 from the aggravated column (working from the top - he crosses those for Bruised, Hurt and Injured
). As the students have run off, he may now spend blood to heal his wounds (a good idea as he is now suffering from a penalty of -2 to all his actions)
. Unfortunately he can only heal the two levels of normal damage caused by the spanner, returning him to Injured, the highest he can get as noted in the Aggravated column.
<p></i> 
<p> <b>Stakes and Other Traditional Anti-Vampire Weapons
<p></b> <i>Oh, theres no steak in the fridge. All weve got is this vegetarian sausage.
<p></i> <i>- Neil, The Young Ones
<p></i> The wooden stake is a traditional anti-vampire weapon which has significant potency in reality
. If struck through the heart by such an item, a vampire is instantly paralysed. Though the victim can sense normally, and is in effect fully aware, they cannot move any part of their bodies - if they are staked with their eyes shut they cann
ot even open them to see. Staking a vampire causes them significant pain, and results in a messy fountain of blood - should such an event take place, a prop of some kind should normally be arranged to mark the spot.
<p> The Kindred cannot survive decapitation, and such an injury will cause them final death. If you have an enemy prone, this is the easiest way to ensure they don
t get up ever again.
<p> Sunlight will damage vampires quickly and seriously. Although very few games will take place where (and more import
antly when) there is a sunlight hazard, it is a possibility. The actual damage done by sunlight is decided purely by the GM present on a dramatic effect
 basis, but will almost invariably be very severe. Remember that health levels lost through exposure to sunlight count as aggravated damage.
<p> 
Other weapons of folklore such as garlic, running water or crosses do not affect the Kindred in general, although tales are told of vampires who were so convinced that garlic repelled them that it actually did, and of
 humans whose faith was so strong that they could drive the undead away with a holy cross.
<p> 
<p> <b>Torpor</b>
<p> 
Vampires can enter, either voluntarily or as a result of extreme damage, a coma-like state known as Torpor. Whilst in torpor, a vampire is completely unconscious, and cannot interact with his surroundings in any way (though it is rumoured that the powerfu
l Antediluvians can use certain disciplines whilst in this state, manipulating the waking world from their slumbers). The amount of time spent in the unconscious state is determined by the kindred
s humanity rating - those with a high level will stay under for a few days, those who have degenerated may run to months or even years. Whatever your humanity level, it is sure that if you enter torpor during a game,
 you will not come round for the rest of play (ask the GM for a new character!), though it is suggested that the blood of an ancient my prematurely revive a comatose vampire.
<p> If forced into torpor by damage, the character will permanently lose one level from one of their physical attributes to represent the serious harm they have come to.

<p> 
Voluntarily entering torpor takes no time, and can done whenever the vampire feels like it. Because there are no physical causes (i.e. extreme damage), a physical attribute point is not lost. Unfortunately, once you are under, you are stuck in that state 
for just as long as you would be if forced out by damage. This means that if you go into torpor during a game you are out of the game. Assuming the evening is not drawing to
 a close, then GMs should give you a new character as though you had died, and will leave a prop denoting the location of the unconscious body of your former self. Youd better hope you are generously dealt with in the background between games!

<p> 
<p>Using Willpower, Virtues and Humanity
<p>Calls will be made for a player to roll using willpower, or more rarely a virtue or humanity rating as a modifier to the die. In this case simply add the current number of dots in the statistic (or white willpower boxes) to the roll.
<p>
<p>Combat
<p> 
The most tricky situation to deal with in an essentially non-contact game is the application of physical violence. This section of the rules covers combat in detail, with plenty of examples, to smooth your way.
<p> 
<p><b>Time in Combat
<p></b> 
Because combat is a complex action to simulate it will often be the case that the usual use of real time will have to be suspended. Usually, two or sometimes even three participants can run combat smoothly in real time, and it is assumed that the actual f
ight took as long as the players did to roll their results and determine what happened. Any more than that will almost certainly necessitate dropping out of real time and into rounds (or turns), which represent approximately ten seconds of real time.

<p> 
<p>As a general rule, in each round a normal person can perform one <i>action</i>. An action can be any of the following:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Striking at an opponent.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Grappling an opponent.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Dodging a blow.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Firing a gun.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Using a discipline (this may take more than one round to complete).
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Resisting a discip
line (such as Dominate).
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Healing your wounds with blood points (q.v.).
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Drinking one point of blood from a victim you have previously bitten.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Performing any other action you could reasonably complete in ten seconds.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Performing a portion of any action which takes longer than ten seconds.
<p> 
Depending on the circumstances, it is usually possible to add a little movement to your basic action. For example it is allowable, given the ten second duration of a turn, for someone at a doorway to declare that they will en
ter a room (taking a few paces to reach their target) and take a swipe at someone in one round. The time taken to reach the victim will be taken into account when the order of action resolution is determined (see below).
<p> 
<p>The Celerity discipline allows characters to perform more than one action per turn - if they choose to activate the power (which happens on a turn-by-turn basis), they receive one extra action for each level of the discipline possessed.
<p>
<p>In <i>addition</i> to their action, the character may do the following:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Spend blood points. Any blood points spent to increase physical stats are crossed off at the end of the statement of intent
 phase, and the bonus attribute points gained are usable immediately during the round. Points spent to heal require that the users action that round be spent on healing their damage. Don
t forget to apply the blood points per round spending limit as denoted on your sheet.
<p> 
<p>If time is broken down into rounds, each round is further split into phases:
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Determination of initiative:</b>
 Each player involved rolls D10 + Initiative, to determine how fast they react to the situation around them (higher is better). Remember this number, as you will need it for the rest of the round.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Declaration of Celerity use.</b>
 Any player who intends to use the Celerity discipline this round should announce this now, along with the Celerity level.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Statement of intent.</b>
 Each player states what they are intending to do in the current round. Possible options include all those listed in the above description
s. The order in which people state their intent is important, and is resolved as follows: First, all those characters not using Celerity announce their intent, in initiative order (<i>lowest</i>
 first). Next, those using Celerity level 1 announce both of their proposed actions, again in order of ascending initiative. Following that, those using Celerity two state intent for all their actions, and so on. <b>Warning:</b>
 Anybody who faffs or is undecided about his action when asked by the GM will be passed over and forfeit all action for that turn.
<p><b></b>* <b></b><b>Action resolution.</b>
 The actions are resolved in a suitable order. Players who do not have to make rolls continue with their stated intent for a duration of ten seconds, unless disturbed by the actions of other players. Actions should be resolved in a logical order, determin
ed by the proximity of the active people to the objects of their actions, and the length of time it would take to perform each task. This order of resolution is important, as occasions will arise when the result 
of one action will affect another, but only if it occurs before the potentially affected event.
<p> 
<p><b><i>Example:</b></i><i> Several people are in a room around 4m square, with one door in the west wall. All hell has broken loose. At the beginning of the round, the players are arranged thus:
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Alex is standing at the door of the room, looking in.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Bill is standing with Chris (with whom he is fighting) in the north-east corner.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Derek is in the middle of the room with Eric, both are fighting one another.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Fred is standing at the wi
ndow in the north wall.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Gerald is in the south-east corner trying to finish reading an ancient scroll which will confer mighty supernatural power upon him.
<p></i> <i>Initiative is resolved in the following order (lowest first): Gerald, Fred, Eric, Derek, Chris, Bill, Alex.
<p>No player elects to use Celerity.
<p>During statement of intent, the following actions are revealed:
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Gerald will try to complete the scroll.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Fred decides to leave by climbing up and through the window.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Eric will punch Derek.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Derek will ignore Erics i
ncoming strike, and punch back.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Chris will punch Bill.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Bill does not want to be hit, and elects to dodge Chriss attack.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Alex decides to support his friend Bill, and will move over to Chris and take a swing at him.
<p></i> <i>The resolution of the actions happens in the following order:
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Chriss punch and Bill
s dodge are resolved first, as they are immediate actions which require no movement to achieve.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Derek
s punch is resolved, as his action is also immediate and he is next in initiative order.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Erics punch is resolved.

<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Alex
s strike at Chris is resolved next - although he won the initiative, Alex had to move a few paces across the room in order to launch his attack.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Owing to the height and small size of the window, Fred is determined to have taken the whole ten seconds of the turn to perform his action. Next turn, he is outside the window.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Unfortunately for Gerald, the scroll is rather long. The GM knows it takes 60 seconds to read, and this is only the third turn of reading. This leaves a further three turns (30 sec
onds) to finish the scroll, with the effect cutting in at the start of the turn after that (i.e. at the start of the seventh turn since the reading started).
<p></i> <i>
<p></i><b><i>Example:</b></i><i> Ian, Ken and Rob are duking it out during a row over musical interpretation. They are all close to one another (i.e. within striking distance) already.
<p>Initiative is rolled as follows: Ian 7, Ken 9, Rob 10.
<p></i> <i>Ken (a definite Toreador) announces Celerity 1, giving him two actions this round.
<p></i> <i>The following actions are announced:
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Ian will punch Rob.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Rob will dodge Ians punch

<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>
Ken (who, despite getting a lower initiative than Rob, announces last because he is using Celerity) decides to punch Ian first, then Rob.
<p></i> <i>The actions are resolved in the following order:
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Kens punch on Ian.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Ians punch and Rob
s dodge.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Kens strike on Rob.
<p></i> <i>The order above was decided by the GM as he feels it is natural that Kens two actions, being almost twice as fast as the other
s, will fit nicely either side of the others single actions. 
<p>
<p></i>It is possible to abort your de
clared actions during a turn if circumstances change before you have executed your manoeuvre. Should you do this you may still perform an alternate action, but if this action requires a roll any skill bonuses to your action are lost - you just roll the D1
0.
<p> 
<p><b><i>Example:</b></i><i> The infamous vampire hunter Professor Van Halen is stalking through a house he knows to be infested with the undead. He moves into a room and spots a person at the far end. The action drops into rounds and declarations are as follows:

<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>The Prof 
elects to stride into the room and drive a stake into his victim.
<p><b></b></i>* <b></b><i>Runs Under The Moon (Van Halen
s target) is actually a werewolf, and elects to do that typical werewolf thing of growing hairy, nine feet tall and nightmarishly deadly.
<p></i> <i>Because the Professor has to move to Runs Under The Moon before striking, the werewolf
s transformation is complete before he arrives. Seeing the new form of his so-called victim, Van Halen elects to abort his action and instead cower under a nearby table.
<p></i>
<p> <b><i>Example: </b></i><i>The scene 
is as before, however there is a second figure in the room with Runs Under The Moon. As the werewolf changes, Van Halen elects to abort his action and instead use the stake on the other person (who declared in their statement of intent that they would sta
nd and watch the action). Because this strike is in place of a declared action, the Professor may not roll the usual D10 + Melee skill to strike, but is limited to D10 only.
<p></i> 
<p> It is possible to rapidly run out of actions. If you are required to make an oppos
ed roll to defend against a physical attack, but your action for the turn has either been spent or declared to be something other than the defence required, your defending roll is made without modifiers.
<p>
<p><b><i>Example:</b></i><i> Justin is being assailed by three opponents, and is not in a position to escape easily. No-one has Celerity. He declares his action this turn as Dodge the first attack anybody makes on me
. His enemies wish to strike, grapple and strike respectively. The first assailant takes his swing, and Justi
n rolls D10 + Dodge skill to avoid. He has now used his action for the round. As the second and third bad guys attack, Justin is still required to make opposing rolls to avoid their grapple and strike attacks, but may only roll a D10 with no additions to 
do so in each case.
<p></i> 
<p> <b>Hitting People
<p></b> 
The basic mechanism for hitting people is the same whether the assailant is attempting to punch, kick, claw or otherwise strike an opponent either unarmed or using a striking weapon (e.g. bat, chair, sword). An single att
ack of this nature counts as an action, thus a character can make such an attempt once per turn.
<p> To determine whether the striking attempt succeeds, an opposed roll is made: 
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
The attacker rolls and adds his appropriate To Hit modifier (Unarmed for punches and kicks).
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
The defender rolls a D10. If the defender has elected to use an action to dodge the strike, he may add his Dodge skill modifier to the result of the die roll.
<p> If the attackers total is less than or equal to the defenders he has missed his strike. If the attacker
s total is higher, he has successfully hit the defender (no calculation of successes is required for to hit rolls).
<p>If the attack hits, the amount of damage done to the target must be determined. Another opposed roll is made:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
The attacker rolls D10 + the appropriate damage modifier. This value is located next to the attack methods name on the character sheet.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
The defender rolls D10 + Resist Damage statistic. This addition is <i>always</i> made to the damage resistance roll, regardless of how the defender has spent his actions. N.B. If the defender rolls a straight 1 on the die, the normal botch rules are <i>
ignored</i> - simply treat his result as 1 + Resist Damage.
<p> If the attackers result is less than or equal to the defenders, no damage is done by the strike. If the attacker exceeds the defender
s total, the defender loses health levels equal to the number of successes gained by the attacker. The nature of this damage is dependant on the weapon being used, but will usually be non-aggravated (see Health).
<p>
<p> <b><i>Example:</b></i><i>
 Demis and Bruce are squaring off for a fight after a chance remark about kaftans. Demis, being a fat Greek singer, has a Punch skill of three and a Dodge skill of two. Bruce, on the other hand, is a legendary martial arts master, whose Punch skill is 10 
and Dodge skill 9.
<p></i> <i>
In the first round, Bruce wins the initiative. Demis declares that he will punch Bruce, and Bruce decides to Dodge the strike. Demis rolls a six, which added to his punch skill of 3 makes 9. Bruce rolls puny 2 but s
till avoids the strike with a total of 11.
<p></i> <i>
<p></i> <i>
In the second round, Demis wins the initiative. Bruce wants to strike back, and Demis tries to dodge. Bruce rolls 5, plus his Punch of 10 gives 15. Demis cannot hope to avoid that, as his total is 5 (roll 3 and Dodge 2). As Bruce
s punch has landed, damage needs to be determined. Bruce rolls 5, and his punch damage modifier is 4, for a total of 9. Demis rolls 5, totalling 7 with his Resist Damage of 2. Bruces excess of 2 (9-7) yields one success, so Demis loses o
ne health level.
<p></i> <i>
<p></i> <i>
In the third round, both Bruce and Demis decide to use their actions to punch one another, and not bother to dodge. Bruce rolls a 1 for his punch, and automatically misses (the GM elects not to subject him to a special effect). Demis rolls a 7, which tota
ls 10 to hit. Bruce has already stated he is using his action to punch, and may therefore not make an addition to his defending roll. He rolls a 6, getting hit by the strike. Demis now rolls a big 10, plus 2 damage equals 12. Bruce rolls a
 2, plus Damage Resist 4 gives 6. Demis wins by 6, for a satisfying  three successes. Bruce loses three health levels, and is deeply annoyed.
<p></i>
<p> <b>Grappling
<p></b> 
An alternative to slugging it out toe-to-toe with your opponent is to try and wrestle him to immobility. This course of action is often the preferred route for those characters who are strong, but have a mediocre dexterity.
<p> If you wish to grapple someone, your first objective (i.e. your action for the first round) is to take them to the floor. To do this, r
equires you to succeed in an opposed roll:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Attacker - roll and add grappling skill.

<p> 
The defender has two options, which determine what skill they apply to their defensive roll. If the defender has no actions to spend on defending against a grapple, as a result of having used them all, or committing them elsewhere
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Option 1: Attempt to avoid getting grabbed, and roll on your dodge skill (i.e. D10 + Dodge). If the defender manages to dodge, the attack misses, and he is free to continue with whatever remaining 
actions he might have this round (subject to standard rules). If the dodge fails, the attackers successes are calculated and applied as a normal grapple roll (explained below).
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Option 2: Allow the attacker to grab you, and grapple back. This is resolved as a standard grappling roll.
<p> A standard grappling roll is resolved as follows:
<p>Both sides have roll and total their skill bonuses. If the rolls are tied, no-one is pinned and both sides may use any further actions they have this round. If there is a winner, his successes are calculated and the loser is immobilised for this many 
<i>actions</i>.
<p>
<p><b><i>Example:</b></i><i>
 Steve and Paul are grappling, Paul has Celerity 1 and therefore gains two actions per round. Steve grapples Paul with his action, and Paul uses his first action to grapple back. Steve, being strong and well trained, wins the roll by 8 - this translates t
o four successes. So, Paul is immobilised for four actions. These will be set out as follows: His next action for the current turn, the two actions in the next turn,
 and his first action in the third turn. Therefore, assuming Steve does not release him in the mean time, the next action Paul can use will be his second action in the round after next.
<p></i> 
<p> During rounds in which you have someone immobilised:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
You may use actions to dodge an incoming attack from a third party, however if you do so you will lose your grip on your victim. You may attempt to re-grapple with your <i>next</i> action unless the defender has absconded in the meantime.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>You may attempt to bite your victim. Rol
l you bite skill against the target
s defensive D10 (only) roll. If you succeed, you may roll damage, and may drain blood points on subsequent actions should the victim be immobilised for further actions. If you fail, you have lost your grip and the target is no longer immobilised.
<p> A character who is immobilised suffers as follows:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
You may no longer roll to defend against attacks by third parties. All attacks by other people will automatically hit, unless they both the attack roll. Once you are hit, you may
 roll your Resist Damage normally, so there is still hope to avoid being seriously injured! If the third party chooses to grapple you, and does not botch, the two characters will be able to immobilise you indefinitely (GM
s discretion as to whether you can still be hit with two folks sitting on you).
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
If you spend blood points increasing your strength at the beginning of any round during which you are immobilised (you must have been grappled to immobility in the <i>previous</i> round, not later on in the current on
e), you may use one action (your first for the round, of course) in an attempt to break free. Both sides roll to grapple from scratch, and the results are as a normal grapple roll.
<p> 
<p>It is assumed that anybody who has been successfully grappled, or has made any grappling rolls (<i>not</i>
 dodge rolls to avoid a grappling attack) is lying on the floor at the end of their action. This may affect the order of action resolution of the current and subsequent turns.
<p>
<p><b>Staking
<p></b> In order to successfully stake somebody, you must do more than merely hit them with the appropriate implement. Combat is run normally as for melee (see 
Hitting People, above) - roll to hit with your weapon skill for the stake, and then roll damage if you hit. In order to successfully paralyse your 
target, you must specify your intent to do so before striking, and you must achieve three successes on both the to hit roll <i>and</i>
 the damage roll. If either of these rolls gets less than the required three successes, any damage scored is still applied normally (as non-aggravated). The results of successfully staking a victim are explained under Health, above.
<p> 
<p><b>Firearms
<p></b> 
Firearms are often rather different in application to other weapons, and rules governing their use are very subject to dramatic effect. As a general rule, they are used at such close quarters that rolling to hit is irrelevant and would slow down game flow
. Therefore, under most circumstances gunshots are assumed to have hit their target. If the attack is taking place from an unusually long distance, the GM may require that each shot is actually rolled for hitting purposes - Roll weapon To hit
 against the targets Dodge (this dodge represents ducking and weaving). Damage is resolved normally.
<p> 
Resolving damage is equally subject to the whims of GMs and (more importantly) dramatic effect. If you are shot two or three times, it is appropriate to perform Damage/Soak opposed rolls for each bullet - many vampires can still function having been repea
tedly shot. If someone pops up and empties a large capacity self-loading pistol into you (that
s 13-18 rounds), there is a choice. Dramatic effect dictates that you will almost certainly take enough damage to knock you to incapacitated, and so you will drop to the floor - this is the usual course of action 
in such situations. If the result is absolutely critical (GM determined), the GM may call a time-out to actually roll damage for each shot, to see exactly what happens - this type of call is most likely in the following situations:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>The gun is so puny or the
 target so hard that most of the bullets are unlikely to cause damage.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
The situation is such that the survival or otherwise of the target will have very important repercussions to the games plot.
<p> 
If a GM is present their ruling is, as ever, final on the method used to resolve firearm disputes. Players in the absence of the GM are encouraged to take the most easy and dramatic course of action rather than faff about rolling zillions of times!
<p>
<p>
<p><b><em>Part 4: Guidelines for Players
<p></b></em> 
<p> This section provides hints and tips for all players of the game.
<p>
<p><b>Familiarise yourself with the background
<p></b> The society of Vampires is very complex and full of etiquette and tradition. If you don
t know how this hangs together, try to obtain (buy, beg, borrow, steal) and read the appropriate manuals in advance. These include (in order of importance):
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Vampire, the Masquerade (essential)

<p><b></b>* <b></b>The Vampire Player
s Guide (essential of you are of a clan not detailed in the main rule book)
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Players guide to the Sabbat (do 
<b>not</b> read unless you are a Sabbat member!)
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Clanbooks relevant to your character.

<p> <b>Important points to look out for:
<p><b></b></b>* <b></b>
The three sects (Camarilla, Sabbat, Inconnu) and the Anarchs
<p><b></b>* <b></b>The political structure of the Camarilla

<p><b></b>* <b></b>The Traditions (rules of the Camarilla)

<p><b></b>* <b></b>The Clans (background and stereotypes)

<p><b></b>* <b></b>Disciplines
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Important history
<p> <b>Plus, if you are Sabbat:
<p><b></b></b>* <b></b>Political structure of the Sabbat
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Rules (and punishments) within the Sabbat
<p><b></b>* <b></b>The Vaulderie, and other <i>
ignoblis ritae</i>
<p> There are documents available within the group which summarise a lot of 
what you need to know. Ask a GM for copies of these, and they should be able to provide you with either the documents themselves or a place where they can be sourced.
<p>
<p><b>Familiarise yourself with the rules
<p></b> 
The rules for our live games have now become fairly stable. Ensure that you read them as thoroughly as possible and familiarise yourself with procedures therein before the game starts. If you have queries, ask more experienced players if they will explain
 or (better) demonstrate. Many situations lose their excitement if they are slowed to a crawl by people constantly looking up rules, so a good understanding will make the game more fun by ensuring the action is swift and smooth.
<p> 
<p><b>Play your role
<p></b> You will (hopefully) be given a character with some depth and his or her own personality. Try to understand this personality and the character
s motivations, and then act as they would. This is particularly important in your relationships with other characters - do not hold out on or otherwise mislead characters who th
e GMs have said are your friends. If you are described as honest and open, this is usually because you are privy to certain information the GMs want disseminated, so again don
t just clam up and become Mister Paranoid for the whole game. Obviously, if your character really is paranoid and close-mouthed, then this behaviour is justified, but see If you really arent getting anywhere
, below. As a final note, occasionally (usually towards the end of a game), one or more players will suddenly shift personality and start to commit random (usually violent) acts. <b>Please</b>
 try to avoid this sort of behaviour, as it tends to screw up the resolution of the plot for the others.
<p> 
<p><b>Dress up!
<p></b> 
Try to find some clothes which suit the character you are playing, and the situation into which you are being placed. If you are attending a party for the Prince, wear a suit or DJ, but if you are returning from a strike mission in the field combats or si
milar clothes would be much more appropriate (Malkavians exceptedyou dont know what to wear, ask in advance. If you really don
t have anything appropriate, it will not kill the game off if you dress as yourself, but do make the attempt to ask around for something as atmosphere is important.
<p> 
<p><b>Read your background carefully
<p></b> 
Your character history and background will contain a great deal of important information. Even apparent throwaway phrases may well refer to something which is going on, so make a point of remembering everything, and referring back if necessary. Vital clue
s can be missed by people who only skim the material they are given, and they often end up getting totally stuck (or, worse, getting someone else totally stuck).
<p> 
<p> <b>Ask questions before play
<p></b> 
If you have any queries regarding your background information, ask the GM to explain as soon as possible. Usually, the GMs will make themselves available for pre-game briefings and will deal with all the players individually.
<p> 
<p><b>Take your current condition into account
<p></b> Dont forget that you may end up in a variety of states of inj
ury or other non-ideal conditions. You should try to play this out. If you are damaged enough to give you a penalty to actions, it really hurts to move. Show this by moving slowly and carefully, perhaps limping or favouring an arm depending on the nature 
of the damage.
<p> 
Willpower can drop to dangerously low levels. If you have a high willpower (say, 9 or 10), act that way - self confident and indomitable. If you WP drops to very low levels, become withdrawn, suggestible and apathetic. This neednt stop you c
ompleting your goals, youll just retain more of a jobsworth attitude to the tasks in hand, and will be more amenable to others giving you instructions.
<p>Lack of remaining blood can have a deleterious effect on the behaviour of vampires. At very low levels they tend to frenzy in blood lust. If you drop to two or three points, tell a GM<br> 
<p><b>If you really arent getting anywhere
<p></b> Sometimes the overall level of paranoia in a game will prevent alliances forming and information spreading. As a general rule, most plo
tlines involve piecing together information from more than one source, so you <b>must</b> communicate. If you get an hour or two into the game and have got nowhere, but you don
t know who to trust, you must take a chance and ally yourself with an individual or group to share information and further your aims and investigation. If this doesnt
 happen expect an informational drought and no fun. Unless you are described as single-minded, feel free to gatecrash any plotlines you run into, and investigate all to the 
fullest - it is often the case that what you have found is linked to your original line of enquiry in some way anyway.
<p> Remember, it is an integral part of a GMs job to worry the hell out of all the players before the game - youve been set up by us, ho ho ho
 and so on - do not take this to heart as it is just the done thing. You may be completely out of any firing line, so dont let this sort of talk stop you from following the hints in this section.
<p>
<p><b>I know you done the blag
<p></b> Think carefully about what you will do if you have pieced together the story of another
s misdemeanour, particularly if you have evidence to back you up. Up until now it has almost universally occurred that the story is immediately made public or taken to the relevant authorities.
 Vampires are very devious, and it is often the case that it would be more useful to have long-term leverage over the culprit than to have him or her executed or whatever. Examine your character
s motivations and attitude to the perpetrator, and come to a decision based upon that information.
<p> 
<p><b>How can I deal with someone that hard?
<p></b> It is occasionally the case that you must remove
 someone who is extremely tough. If you have them, firearms may help, but your best bet is to team up. A character can only actually dodge one attack out of the large number that will be taking place (exce
pting the Celerity discipline - see the rules of play), so multiple attackers should be able to down even a mighty foe.
<p> 
<p><b>React appropriately
<p></b> Often, kindred commit misdemeanours dur
ing the game. It seems, however, that in the vast majority of cases, everyone just ignores this fact and carries on regardless! Breaking social or legal codes should come at a price, often a dear one. It should be explained that in the long running game b
etween the kindred, immortals play for points as well as lives. The average Vampire will react with horror at the thought of being socially humiliated or politically damaged (even Brujah anarchs have a sense of pride and kudos within their packs), and so 
death is not the only thing you should fear.
<p> 
<p><b>Communicate with the GM, but be careful when contradicting him
<p></b> 
Try to brief the GM occasionally on your progress, any items (props) you may have in your possession, what you plan to do next and so on. This will allow the GM to drop hints or push plots where appropriate to keep the flow going nicely.
<p> Occasionally, you will be present when a GM informs a third party of some information about your character. If this is incorrect, don
t pipe up straight away - they may be feeding false information (perhaps as the result of a botched roll). Grab them straight after and point out the error, and the GM will put the third party right if it is appropriate to do so. 
<p>
<p><b>Be trustworthy
<p></b> 
The rules and situations often require you to do things against your best interests. These include acting blind or deaf, ignoring people Obfuscating (hidden) in a room whilst you discuss sensitive information and so on. It is vitally important that you

<p> A second point along these lines is the marki
ng off of Blood Points used and other changes to your character. If you have been standing, preparing for a fight by spending Blood Points, and the fight doesn
t happen, the blood is still spent - mark it off as lost. The same goes for use of Willpower and for the loss of health levels.
<p>
<p><b>Dont give up</b>
<p>The game has to end at some point, but some plots will always be resolved before others. If you have completed your goals for the evening, please dont go around whinging that you want to stop now. Other peopl
e still want to play their sections to full resolution, and you still may be needed. Try to involve yourself with stuff that is still going one rather than giving up and hiding. These games do take a long time.
<p>
<p><b>Stay awake
<p></b> 
These games do take many hours to play out, and will be run at night - this is a fact known by all the players in advance. Try to take sensible precautions to deal with this. If at all possible, make sure you get plenty of sleep the night before, so that 
you can go on to the small hours w
ithout either crashing out or becoming completely obnoxious. Of course, circumstances may dictate that you cannot be as rested as you would like, but put a brave face on it and soldier on. The harder you try, the more involved you will become, and you wil
l forget your fatigue until the game winds down.
<p> 
<p><b>Stay sober (and straight!)
<p></b> It is often the case that players, particularly new ones, will view the game as an opportunity to get drunk and play about. This, unfortunately, doesn
t tend to work as in order to
 succeed in your goals for the evening you will certainly need your wits about you. Another aspect to this is that if you are drunk and unable to play properly, other characters whose plots rely on action by yourself could end up being ruined.
<p> 
<p><b>You get out what you put in, and so does everyone else.
<p></b> 
Remember, the game works best when people are enthusiastic, and try hard to play their roles and solve the mysteries presented to them. There is quite a large body of experience building up amongst the GMs of th
e group, and we are now producing games in which nearly all stories can be concluded successfully, so try not to lose heart. When people aren
t trying not only does it make them bored, but it spoils the game for the others (in two ways - as well as potent
ially succumbing to the general apathy exuding from such a player, any plot lines the character is inherently involved in may grind to a halt and ruin other
s chances of dealing with them) and makes it less likely that the writers will produce another game in the future. A plain fact has emerged from previous games - those who had the most fun were the ones who worked the hardest.
<p> 
<p><b><em></b></em><b><em>Part 5: Guidelines for GMs
<p></b></em> 
<p> This portion is intended to outline the best ways to write and run live games.
<p> 
<p> <b>Dont go it alone
<p></b> It is <i>extremely</i>
 difficult to fully plan and implement a whole game single handed. There are many characters to write, usually with complex interactions between them. At the least, a second person can proof these documents to ensure that they remain consiste
nt with each other and with the world background as it stands. A proposed guideline is one GM per six to eight players.
<p> 
<p><b>Dont actually play
<p></b> 
Experience has shown that it is very difficult to be a full time player and GM at the same time. A much better plan is to only play walk on parts who should only be around for a matter of minutes. The only other roles are ones which should under no circum
stances be given to players who might abuse them - Mages and Faeries are obvious examples - but the problems with GM
ing whilst playing cannot be over stressed. The other role a GM should take is a character who is extremely likely to die early on during the game - it is unfair to give a player such a role.
<p> 
<p><b>Start NOW (give out character information as much in advance as possible)
<p></b> There is <i>never</i>
 enough time to do everything for a game - the sooner you start the better. The longer players have to digest their characters, the better they will know them and therefore play them. They will have time to ask questions and to fam
iliarise themselves with appropriate disciplines and abilities. 
<p> 
<p><b>Leave concrete evidence<br> </b> 
Invariably, either as part of the main plot or as one of the many subplots, someone has committed a relatively serious misdemeanour. Unfortunately, there is rarely enough evidence to pin the crime upon this person. Whilst occasionally it is more interesti
ng to have no real evidence, it should normally be possible to bring something out that is at least partially incriminating. It adds spice to the perpetrators game, 
and gives others a feeling that they can do something useful rather than be frustrated that although they know what is going on, they can do nothing. The only caveat to this point is that if the evidence is damning enough, no perpetrator will ever leave t
he game alive. It pays to use caution, perhaps including evidence which bears a strong implication but nothing irrefutable. The other thing to note is that the more damning the evidence, the better it should be hidden, preferably in several portions which
 must be pieced together.
<p> Of course, some criminals are designed to get away with it as part of the plot, but if there are such characters, there shouldn
t be any players whose primary goal is to catch that person.
<p>
<p><b>dont be too hard in the people you set up
<p></b> 
In addition to the above, it seems that the first few games in which people committed crimes had them doing things which would almost certainly result in death. The problem here is that as soon as they are found out they are often for the chop. It is
 proposed that misdemeanours be found that whilst not ultimately fatal, will produce extremely embarrassing or politically damaging results if they come to light. Impress upon the players that many of them hold their reputation almost as high as their (un
)lives.
<p> 
<p><b>Things that go BANG in the night
<p></b> 
Guns can be the great leveller in kindred society; fill almost any vampire full of lead and they will be sufficiently incapacitated to be completely at the mercy of anyone nearby. Gun control is a tricky problem, as
 it should be easily possible for nearly all kindred to get whatever guns they require. Banning them completely for a game usually requires a good excuse - Mages have enforced an area in which they simply cease to function has been the most effective, but
 is very difficult to use more than once. Just telling players not to bring them is OK, but likely to evoke cries of unfairness and there is a good point here - why would any self respecting person who has access to firearms and is going into a dangerous 
situation elect to leave them at home? Upholding the rules of <i>Elysium</i>
 are up to the vampire concerned, though he should be reminded that to break this law is to incur the wrath of the entire Kindred establishment in a permanent and often fatal way. Generally, if people are to be searched for weapons during the game, the se
arch should actually be physically carried out - full marks to players ingenious enough to smuggle items through such searches. 
<p> 
<p><b>Communicate
<p></b> Always make sure you are consistent with your co-GMs on rulings and knowledge. If you have had to explain and elaborate on a few points about a character
s background, note down what you have told them and inform the other GMs. There is nothing more confusing than patently conflicting information is given out by different (or the same, unless said conflicts are part of the plot of course.
<p> 
<p><b>Enable kick start of a stalled plot
<p></b> Plotlines can occasionally stall completely. For example, if all the people who hold evidence about a crime are all keeping
 quiet (usually as a coincidence), then the investigators will have a thin time of it. To prevent this, try to add certain deus ex machina
 type devices which can get the plot going. Visits by people with extra information, or deliveries of extra evidenc
e to be given to a new (and less paranoid) character can be staged. These should be thought about in advance, and hopefully not at all contrived-seeming! They should not be used if the plot to which they relate is coming along nicely.
<p> 
<p><b>Have plenty of events and walk-ons
<p></b> 
This relates to the kick start point mentioned above. The GM can have a lot of fun by turning up as different characters who just appear for short periods and throw spanners in the works, get drained of blood, or impart otherwise unknown information to th
e highest bidder. Other events (meteor strikes, sudden possessions by demons, murders, whatever) also add spice to the game and keep the players guessing. A balance must be struck here - try not to organise too many, as they may distract from 
the politicking rather than adding to it.
<p> 
<p><b>Give yourself some room
<p></b> 
If the venue allows, try to keep a room out of bounds to players so you can have quick GM chats and store props here. Lock it if possible! It helps in the organisation if you can lay out required props and information neatly, for quick and easy access.

<p> 
<p><b>Never underestimate the players capacity for lateral thinking
<p></b> This is best illustrated with an example. At the Boswinger game (Feb 97), Nat was in possession of a floppy disk with important
 information on it, but there was no computer to hand. Clare
s magic briefcase could provide one, but at the cost of 10 blood points to work the magic. We figured that this cost would force two or more people to cooperate to get the machine. Wrong. Despite this being an ostensibly peaceful party at the Prince
s residence, Nat decided to bump off some poor unsuspecting shmuck and fed them to the case - thus creating a new (and unscheduled by the GMs) murder which could have potentially damaged several other 
plotlines. Nat failed, but it could have been interesting if he hadn
t. The point is that things which are easy to see with hindsight are rather harder to when writing, so beware and try to second-guess this sort of threat to the plot before you write it.
<p> 
<p><b>Look out for the knock-on effects of disciplines and other capabilities
<p></b> 
Various capabilities can have dire and unforeseen consequences - disciplines are referred here but it could be anything else. If you suddenly find that every player with aura percepti
on can spot the perpetrator of a crime long before the evidence is due to come out, the game will be short and rather pointless. Although this is a trivial example, many more exist, so in assigning capabilities to player characters, check each one to make
 sure that they cannot blow a plot out of the water before you start.
<p> 
<p><b>Have some spare characters
<p></b> It pays to have some spare characters who fit well into the game prepared. These can be given to people whose original characters have died early, giving them 
something to do. You can even give these characters essential jobs or information, and play them as a walk-on if no player is available when they are needed. Try to make them as detailed and rounded as possible, because they may end up being played for lo
nger than the original character.
<p> 
<p><b>Dont try to organise the whole event
<p></b> 
If you are writing and running the game, draft in volunteers to organise the logistics. This allows you to concentrate on getting a first class plot and characters ready, whilst others:
<p> Book the venue
<p>Organise transport
<p> Arrange the catering
<p> Deal with money for all the above
<p>Work out who is playing*
<p>*This rather depends - usually the GMs need a relatively accurate number of players before commencing the writing. This obviously requires a certain amount of juggling<br> 
<p><b><em>Part 6: Organisation Guide
<p></b></em> 
<p> This section covers the logistics of hosting a Vampire game.
<p>
<p><b>Get money in advance
<p></b> If the game requires any money at all, and it certainly should to cover food even if accommodation is free, a grea
t effort should be made to collect the money in advance. This will help prevent last minute drop-outs occurring, which can seriously damage the game and are very difficult to paste over.
<p> 
It has been suggested that even zero-outlay games should allow people to play only if they stump up some kind of cash deposit, to be returned at the end of the game as long as they play (or if they give reasonable notice of dropping out).
<p>
<p><b>Devise menus in plenty of time
<p></b> If you are catering for the group, a menu should be arranged in advance. This enables several questions to be answered:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Can all the players eat the suggested foods (look out for allergies and vegetarianism)?
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Will the cooking facilities at the venue cope with the planned meals?
<p><b></b>* <b></b>Is the required food of a suitable cost?

<p><b><em>Appendix A: Vampiric Disciplines
<p></b></em>
<p>This section is contains brief notes on the use of disciplines as well as spaces to record a character
s prowess in each area. A character should receive a sheet with the appropriate disciplines to the appropriate levels (i.e. unless there is a good reaso
n they should only get a listing for their own available disciplines) cut from this text. They should also get the introductory paragraph below.
<p>
<p><b><em>Disciplines
<p></b></em>
<p>
The discipline descriptions given are valid for the LRP context, and any contradictions with the original rulebooks supersede those books. Please take any queries to a GM or knowledgeable player. The skill level calculations provide the bonus to your D10 
roll. Passive rolls are listed with a difficulty, the number which must be <i>exceeded </i>for the discipline to succeed. Any attributes marked with an asterisk (*) may be modified during the game by various means (e.g. spend
ing blood points), so remember to keep track of your current levels. As a final note, please also remember to modify your rolls according to any injuries you have sustained.
<p>As usual, if you have any queries, take them to a GM (or a rules head) as soon as you can.
<p>
<p><b>Animalism
<p></b>The animalism disciplines are very limited in a live context, however it is possible to come up with certain creative uses.
<p>
<p><b>1. Sweet Whispers
<p></b>Allows basic (telepathic) communication with an animal. Eye contact must be maintained. The animal can be persuaded to do favours <i>that it can understand</i>
 on a successful roll, and may be able to divulge certain information to the character.
<p>Passive Roll:Manipulation (<em>     </em>) + Animal Ken (<em>     </em>) = [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:6, modified by GM for roleplaying and animal specifics.
<p>
<p><b>2. The Beckoning
<p></b>
User can summon all, or specific, animals of a certain species from the surrounding area. They will not be compelled to come, but those that do are likely (though not guaranteed) to be inquisitive and friendly. To
 use this power, the call must be audible (singing to attract birds, howling for wolves etc.)
<p>Passive Roll:Charisma (<em>     </em>) + Survival (<em>     </em>) = [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:6+ (ask the GM).
<p>Successes:1 - one animal responds  \fldinst SYMBOL 224 \f "Wingdings" \s 10  5 - all animals in area respond.
<p>
<p><b>3. Song of Serenity
<p></b>By touch and song, removes the Beast from an individual. A being in this state will not fight, struggle, or resist any attack, and will accept anything that happens to him as normal, showing no reaction. <i>
This power only works on animals and mortals.</i>
<p>To succeed, a roll must be made every minute. When successes equal to the targets Willpower have been gathered, the Beast is gone.
<p>Passive Roll:Manipulation (<em>     </em>) + Empathy (<em>     </em>) = [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:7
<p>Successes:As described above.
<p>
<p><b>Auspex
<p></b>
<p><b>1. Heightened Senses
<p></b>
You may sharpen any one (or more than one if you require) of your five senses to twice the normal levels. This can have a variety of effects, limited by the creativity of players and the limits imposed by the GM, though the most
 used example is noted below. If, whilst using this power, a heightened sense encounters an excessive stimulus (a bright flash of light, a loud noise, a dense release of ammonia), it will be temporarily shut down for a period of fifteen minutes (if a GM i
s on hand, or the players reach a consensus, and the stimulus is judged to be particularly weak or strong, the period may be adjusted up or down). Damaged senses must be role-played - put your fingers in your ears firmly if you are deaf, close (or even co
ver) your eyes if blind.
<p>Specific example: Listening at Doors. Listening at a closed door requires you to stand by the door with your ear cupped to denote you are listening (<i>back to the door</i>
, you cannot see through it). At this point the players behind the door are obliged to continue their conversation with the door open. Should anyone approach the listener from outside the room, he must immediately close the door until the distraction has 
passed. This use can be negated by sources of interfering noise such as tapping on the door.
<p>Listening at an open door (that is, really open rather than opened by you for the purposes of the above example) when the parties are too quiet to hear fully requires that you collar one of them after the conversation and have it repeated. If you were dis
tracted by passers by a lot, ask only for vague details - <b>role-play this!</b>
<p>No Roll Required.
<p>
<p><b>2. Aura Perception
<p></b>You may determine the colours of a beings aura, and tell certain things from this. The following are discernible, startin
g with the easiest (this is a general order, the GMs may modify it for individuals, and only certain people know what some of the answers mean):
<p>Is the being a vampire? (This is the only thing you can discern if you only get one success).
<p>The beings nature - vampire, human, werewolf, ghost etc.
<p>A Vampires generation (approximate).
<p>The beings general mood/state of mind.
<p>The presence of any Magical or Divine aura (magic use).
<p>The type of Magic present (thaumaturgy, hedge magic, sphere magic).
<p><b>Note:</b> Do not make this roll yourself - ask a GM to as you may not know if you botched (rolled a 1) and got misleading information. If you attempt to read someone
s aura more than once in an evening, the GM is entitled to give you misleading information on <i>any</i> failure, not just rolls of one.
<p>Passive Roll:Perception (<em>     </em>) + Empathy (<em>     </em>) = [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:8
<p>Successes:Increasing successes yield more information. 
<p>
<p><b>3. The Spirits Touch
<p></b>Some impressions of the history of an object as well as people to have recentl
y handled it can be gained by touch. The difficulty is determined by the time since important events have happened, the relationship of the item to its handlers and so on.
<p>Passive Roll:Perception (<em>     </em>) + Empathy (<em>     </em>) = [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:GM determined.
<p>Successes:Increasing successes yield more detailed information. 
<p>
<p><b>Celerity
<p></b><i>Theres many who tried to prove that theyre faster
<p>But they didnt last and they died as they tried
<p>- Hell Bent for Leather, Judas Priest
<p></i>
<p>Celerity does not yield a variety of
 specific powers. Instead, it grants the vampire increased speed of action when used by spending blood points. Each time a vampire opts to use Celerity, he or she spends one blood point and announces the use and level - for example if you have three level
s in this discipline you would call Celerity Three. At this point you have your level times three seconds (e.g. at level 3 you would gain nine seconds) to act during which everyone else must stand still. Note that you <b>cannot</b>
 spend more than one blood point at once to multiply your free time.
<p>When someone declares Celerity use, others with the discipline may counter - if someone uses Celerity 3 and you counter with Celerity 2, they only receive one free three-second period before you may move. Everyone else will have to wait until the both of 
you have played out your six remaining seconds. It is even possible to outbid someone if you have a higher Celerity than them - using Celerity 4 to counter a bid of 3 gives <i>you</i> three seconds over <i>them</i>, and you still bot
h have nine over the rest of the players.
<p>In a combat situation, each point of Celerity yields an extra action in the round in which it was declared. These are used in exactly the same way as the free seconds given during normal play, including order of resolution against other parties with the d
iscipline. The combat section of the rules expands on this point.
<p>
<p><b>Daimonion
<p></b><i>Some day, some day, some day - Daimonion!
<p>- Sisters of Mercy (well, almost)
<p></i>This is the Demon powered discipline of the evil Baali.
<p>
<p><b>1. Sense the Sin
<p></b>The user of this power may sense the targets greatest character flaw, be it a low virtue, a weak will, a derangement or whatever. You may ask the targets player (they must act as if they don
t know you know), or ask a GM - this is probably better as a decision as to the greatest flaw can be made more objectively.
<p>Attacker:Perception (<em>     </em>) + Empathy (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Defender:Self Control (or Instincts for Sabbat targets) + 4.
<p>
<p><b>2. Fear of the Void Below</b>
<p>If the vampire successfully uses Sense the Sin on a target, he may then use this power. The Baali tells the target of his inevitable damnation beyond any hope for redemption. If the target fails to resist this power, he is overcome with fear.
<p>Attacker:Wits (<em>     </em>) + Intimidation (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Defender:Self Control (or Instincts for Sabbat targets) + 4.
<p>Successes:1 or 2: Victim flies into a terror frenzy.
<p>3 or more: Victim collapses in useless panic for 10 minutes.
<p>
<p><b>3. Flames of the Netherworld
<p></b>Using this power, the Baali may hurl bl
asts of sickly green hellfire. Blood Points must be invested in each bolt, the resultant (aggravated) damage modifier being equal to the Blood Points spent (e.g. spend two blood points for a D10 + 2 blast of damage).
<p>
<p><b>Dark Thaumaturgy
<p></b><i>I got with the winning team
<p>But nothing ever seems to be what it seems
<p>- They, Entombed.
<p></i>
<p>These powers exactly duplicate those of Thaumaturgy, however the power source is different. Thaumaturgists use the power of vampiric blood to do their work, whereas Dark Thaumaturgist
s use the Infernal Power of Hell.
<p>
<p><b>1. A Taste for Blood
<p></b>
If you have a sample of blood from a target, you may tell certain things about them. The blood must be fresh (i.e. liquid and not settled out), and you must physically touch it to get the effect. The details gained are the <i>current</i>
 state of the target, not the state at which he was in when the blood was lost.
<p>Passive Roll:Perception (<em>     </em>) + Occult (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:7
<p>Successes:1.   How many Blood Points are in the target
<p>2. * . Above, plus how
 recently a vampiric target has fed
<p>3. * . 
Above, plus the approximate generation of the target
<p>Also, higher numbers allow more accurate information - the GM may well be quite
<p>vague when you only get one or two successes. Other information gained about other
<p>types of target (e.g. Lupines) is at the GMs discretion.
<p>
<p><b>2. Blood Rage
<p></b>The user may cause the target to expend blood points, in any way the attacker sees fit. A side effect of this is that the victims rolls to resist frenzy will increase by one for 15
 minutes. Touch is required to operate this power, though the victim may take a few moments to notice he is (e.g.) suddenly much stronger and could well fail to realise why.
<p>Attacker:Dexterity (<em>     </em>) + Subterfuge (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Defender:Willpower.
<p>Successes:One blood point can be forced to be used for each success the attacker gets.
<p>
<p><b>3. Blood of Potency</b>
<p>This discipline allows the user to lower his effective generation for a time. Lower generation vampires can hold more blood points, spend blood fast
er, have higher trait maxima and are harder to Dominate. Each time this discipline is used, it costs the user Blood Points equal to the generation drop chosen (see below). Once the effect is running, it cannot be shortened or changed in any way, and the p
ower cannot be used again until the old one has worn off. In any case, the power cannot be attempted more than once per hour.
<p>The roll for this discipline should always be done in the company of a GM, and should be done using the <i>original</i> Vampire rules (the GM will know how to handle this).
<p>Passive Roll:Dexterity (<em>     </em>) + Subterfuge (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]   (Roll this many D10s)
<p>Difficulty:8 (i.e. Rolls of 8 or above are successes)
<p>Successes:Each success allows one generation drop for one hour. For example, if you gain
<p>three successes, and your original generation is 10th, you may opt to drop to 9th for
<p>three hours (costing one Blood Point), 8th for one and a half hours (costing two
<p>BPs), or 7th for one hour (costing three BPs). The minimum duration is one hour.
<p>
<p><b>4. Theft of Vitae
<p></b>
Allows you to steal blood from a target from a distance of up to 50 feet (the target must be I plain view). The blood leaves the target receptacle (pouring out of bodily orifices if the target is a being) and flies through the air to the Thaumaturgist, th
us making it obvious to all onlookers, as well as the target, what is going on! Blood taken in this way is absorbed into the users Blood Pool, and <i>cannot</i> be collected in a receptacle for later use. The user may bleed into a container
 for storage whilst using this discipline, but the Blood stored will be treated as his (for purposes of other blood magics etc.), not that of the target.
<p>Attacker:Intelligence (<em>     </em>) + Medicine (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Defender:Willpower. If target is a container, not a character, its effective WP is 5.
<p>Successes:One blood point can be stolen for each success the attacker gets.
<p>
<p><b>5. Cauldron of Blood</b>
<p>This particularly nasty power allows the user to boil the blood of a target by touch. If successful, this is al
most invariably fatal to mortals. In vampires, one (non-aggravated) wound level is inflicted for each point boiled. In either case, the target loses the Blood Points boiled. The attacking vampire must choose how many points he wishes to boil <i>before</i>
 rolling for the attack.
<p>Attacker:Willpower.
<p>Defender:Number of points to boil (chosen by attacker) + 4.
<p>Successes:If the attacker succeeds, the chosen number of blood points are destroyed. If the
<p>defender wins (or draws) the roll, no damage is done.
<p>
<p><b>Dementation
<p></b><i>But theres one thing I must say
<p>Before they lock me up again -
<p>Youd be safer at the back
<p>When Im having an attack!
<p>- Hyperactive!, Thomas Dolby
<p></i>The Malkavians of the Sabbat are virtually the sole practitioners of this art.
<p>
<p>
<p><b>Dominate
<p></b><i>Trust the Psi Corps. The Psi Corps is your friend.
<p>- Psi Corps advert, ISN news channel</i>
<p>Dominate allows for a variety of mind controlling powers. In order to initiate a domination attempt, direct eye contact must be made with the target. The efficacy of dominate power
s depends greatly on the generation of target, and are subject to an additional modifier (the Generation Fudge Factor, or GFF) worked out as follows:
<p><b></b>* <b></b>If the target is a <b>lower</b>
 generation then the attacker, the attacker receives a penalty to his roll equal to his generation minus the generation of the target. For example, Mr. Green is 12th
 generation and has a Mesmerise bonus of +7. He tries to mesmerise Mr. Purple who is 9th generation, thereby giving a penalty of 3 (3 = 12 - 9), so his final roll would be D10 + 4 (4 = 7 - 3), against Mr. Purple
s resistance roll of D10 + Willpower.
<p><b></b>* <b></b>
Those attempting to dominate those of equal or higher generation do <b>not</b> modify to their roll.
<p>
Unless otherwise noted in a specific description, if you fail in an attempt to use any dominate power on a vampire (or other supernatural being), you may not attempt to use any dominate power on them again for 30 minutes. This time limit is halved for ord
inary (puny) humans.
<p>As a final note, it is recommended that should a defender roll a one against a Dominate attack, he or she should <i>not</i>
 be subjected to a special effect as described in the rules - the mere fact of automatic failure in this instance should be damaging enough!
<p>
<p><b>1. Command the Wearied Soul (a.k.a. Command the Wearied Mind)
<p></b>Allows the challenger to give the target a one phrase command (Leave the room). The command will not be obeyed if it is potentially <i>damaging</i>
 to the target - examples of a non-obeyed command include Stand still while I hit you, and the like. You may get the target to hand over important items or information, and there are a variety of other uses for this discipline.

<p>The order given must be a single action which can be obeyed immediately, and must not set the victim up for further orders not part of the original phrase. Examples:
<p>Leave the room is OK (though the victim could come right back in).
<p>Leave the room and shut the door behind you will fail, as it requires two actions.
<p>Give me the amulet is OK, as long as the victim has the amulet.
<p>Get me the amulet will work as long as the item is nearby, the victim knows where it is and nobody actually has it in their possession. 
<p>Answer the following question truthfully does not contain an immediate action, and will fail.
<p>Attacker:Manipulation (<em>     </em>) + Intimidation (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>], minus any GFF.
<p>Defender:Willpower.
<p>Successes:More successes will engender more vigorous compliance.
<p>
<p><b>2. Mesmerise</b>
<p>Allows the user to implant a suggestion in the subjects mind. The suggestion may be acted on immediately,
 or may have a trigger to launch it later. Such suggestions may be quite complex, but eye contact must be maintained throughout the attempt (though only the attacker can break this contact - the subject is in a trance). The subject <i>cannot</i>
 be forced to do something against their nature (they should ask a GM if they are unsure). When a suggestion is successfully implanted, the victim should note what it was and how many successes the attacker achieved.
<p>Any character may only have one suggestion is his mind at a time. If a new suggestion is attempted, the attacker and defender roll as usual, and take note of the attacker
s successes. The new suggestion will only supplant the old if the new number of successes <i>exceeds</i> those gained by the attacker who placed the old one.
<p>Attacker:Manipulation (<em>     </em>) + Leadership (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>], minus any GFF.
<p>Defender:Willpower.
<p>Successes:More than 3 are required to make the subject do anything that appears strange to
<p>him, such as pretending to be a chicken (unless they are that way inclined). Higher levels of success produce more pronounced effects.
<p>
<p><b>3. The Forgetful Mind
<p></b>This power can be used to implant or remove memories in the mind of the victim.
<p>Attacker:Wits (<em>     </em>) + Subterfuge (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>], minus any GFF.
<p>Defender:Willpower.
<p>Successes:1.   May only create memories (minutes worth) - memory lasts one day.
<p>2. * . 
May also remove but not alter memory (a few minutes worth).
<p>3. * . 
May make slight alterations to a few minutes of existing memory.
<p>4. * . 
May alter or remove large sequences (hours).
<p>5. * . 
May reconstruct whole periods of subjects life.
<p>
<p><b>Fortitude
<p></b>This discipline yields no powers at each level. Instead, it is an expression of the Vampire
s supernatural ability to withstand a incredible amounts of damage. Each level of fortitude adds to your damage resistance bonus (this should have already been factored in on your character sheet).
<p>
<p>Melpominee
<p>
<p>Obeah
<p>
<p><b>Obfuscate
<p></b>This is the art of stealth and invisibility. Note that this is not true invisibility, and users of this disciple wil
l still show up as perfectly normal on film etc. - the discipline actually works on the minds of those who can see you such that they subconsciously edit you out of their view. If you are walking down a busy street, people will move to avoid you without n
oticing that they are doing so, and your passage will not be remembered.
<p>When using Obfuscate, you will be required to wear a label showing the level to which you have the discipline. This is because the Auspex discipline may allow other kindred to see thro
ugh your power, but only if their Auspex rating is higher than your Obfuscate level.
<p>Two hand signals are required to show that you are using specific powers. For all the hiding powers (1, 2, 4, 5), you must have your hands crossed over your chest to indicate the power is active (remember not to conceal your label with this gesture). When
 you use Mask of the Thousand Faces (level 3), you should keep your index finger touching your chin, to indicate I am in disguise.
<p>
<p><b>1. Cloak of Shadows
<p></b>User must be in a place of at least partial cover (behind a lamp-post, in a shady corner), and must remain completely motionless for the power to work.
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b>2. Unseen Presence
<p></b>
This is a more powerful version of Cloak of Shadows. It allows the user to move about without being noticed, but he must be out of site when he actually activates the power. In other words, you must be hidden to begin with, but you may then move into full
 view and remain concealed from others. Interaction with objects, talking and violent physical action (etc.) will cause the user to be noticed unless the following roll is made:
<p>Passive Roll:Wits (<em>     </em>) + Stealth (<em>     </em>) = [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:GM determined (Defaults to 8).
<p>Successes:<i>At least three successes</i> must be obtained to remain hidden.
<p>
<p><b>3. Mask of the Thousand Faces
<p></b>This discipline is aimed at altering other
s perception of you rather than removing it completely. Using it, you may disguise yourself (as far as physical and vocal appearance are concerned) as somebody else, whether th
ey are made up or actually a real person. Of course, if you are impersonating someone, you must take care to act as they would or risk giving the game away.
<p>No Roll Required.
<p>
<p><b>4. Vanish from Minds Eye
<p></b>Taking the stealth motif further again, this actually allows the Vampire to disappear from someone
s view, even if they were looking straight at the Kindred at the time, thought the disappearing character must succeed in an opposed roll to do this. Characters with weak minds (Imperial Stormtroopers for exampl
e) may even forget they saw the Vampire in the first place. If the viewer does forget seeing the vampire, it will only be for a moment unless the vampire immediately leaves the vicinity.
<p>User:Charisma (<em>     </em>) + Stealth (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Defender:Wits + Alertness.
<p>Successes:At least three successes are required to disappear from plain sight.
<p>If more successes are rolled than the targets current willpower, the target will forget ever seeing the user.
<p>
<p><b>5. Cloak the Gathering
<p></b>With this power, you may exte
nd any of your other Obfuscate powers to beings in addition to yourself. If any of the characters included compromise the hiding (or disguise) effect, it is only that character who loses the benefit. If any rolls are required, one roll is made by the cast
er which applies to all the targets. One additional person may be included for each dot in stealth the user has.
<p>Rolls required depend on effect being used.
<p>
<p><b>Obtenebration
<p></b>These are the powers of darkness and shadow. At higher levels this discipline can manipulate the Abyss itself<br> 
<p><b>1. Shadow Play
<p></b>Allows the manipulation of shadows, and the dimming of local light sources. As well as a variety of effects the player may think up, the use of this power may confer small bonuses to the Vampire
s Stealth and Intimidation rolls (GM discretion on a per situation basis). Activation of this power requires a Blood Point.
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b>2. Shroud of Night</b>
<p>The user can create a volume of complete and actually rather solid darkness. The range of this power is about 50 
yards. The matter actually deadens sound as well as making vision impossible - most characters are completely blind, and even those with Gleam of Red Eyes and Heightened Senses suffer a penalty of 3 to all their rolls. The volume may be moved (within rang
e) at walking speed if the user devotes his full attention to doing so (i.e. he cannot move or speak). The darkness may be summoned in areas the caster cannot see (such as behind a closed door), but not if more complicated directions are needed (down abou
t ten feet and then left 30, etc.). If the user cannot see the location, the use of this power requires a Blood Point.
<p>Passive Roll:Manipulation (<em>     </em>) + Occult (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:7 (9 if the target area is out of sight.
<p>Successes:For each success, a volume of around 1000 cubic feet (10x10x10) can be filled.
<p>
<p><b>3. Arms of the Abyss</b>
<p>The user may summon several tendrils of darkness to grasp foes. There must be a nearby area of quite deep shadow as a source for these things. Each tendril has Str 4, Dex 3 and Brawl 2. (This gives it a grapple rating of +6). They cannot strike.
<p>Passive Roll:Manipulation (<em>     </em>) + Occult (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:7
<p>Successes:For each success, 6 feet of tendril can be created. So, with four successes, you can
<p>create four at 6 feet, two at 12 feet or one at 24 feet long.
<p>
<p><b>4. Nightshades
<p></b>The vampire may create murky and indistinct shadowy shapes, such as those of himself (a useful diversion) or of monsters or whatever. Each shape is three dimensional, normally a
round man-sized, and is insubstantial (attacks pass through them). An alternate use of this power is to fill an area with flitting and confusing forms, in order to disorient the occupants. This second use causes all affected characters to lose three from 
initiative checks, and one from all dice roll totals. Affected characters are all the enemies in the area, pus all allies who do not have Obtenebration.
<p>Passive Roll:Wits (<em>     </em>) + Occult (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:7
<p>Successes:If creating normal forms, each success creates one man sized form. Alternately,
<p>successes can be spent to increase the size of a creation - two successes for twice
<p>man sized, three for 3 times and so on.
<p>If filling an area with confusing shapes, a 10x10x10 area can be filled for each
<p>success gained.
<p>
<p><b>Potence
<p></b>Potence provides no specific powers. Instead, it is a measure of a Vampire
s supernatural physical strength. Every point of Potence you have is treated as an additional point of strength - the advantage here over no
rmal strength is that you can still enhance that basic statistic through spending blood points to a limit of five, and additional Potence points will be added over and above the new level, potentially taking you well beyond the limit for normal kindred. I
n specific strength based tests, the GM may allow Potence-equipped characters other miscellaneous bonuses, so be sure to mention it if you are asked for your strength stat.
<p>
<p><b>Presence
<p></b>Presence is a way of manipulating how others react to you, enhancing your 
charisma to high levels. The use of Presence disciplines does not require eye contact with the subject (unless otherwise noted), and may act on more than one target.
<p>
<p><b>1. Awe
<p></b>
This power causes all target in your location to be attracted to you and easily swayed to our point of view. This is not a terribly large effect - it could not be used to raise a crowd of loyal retainers, though it might help bring a crown around to the u
sers point of view. The duration of the effect is variable, and usually lasts as long as the action the user was trying to augment - e.g. for the length of a rousing speech.
<p>Passive Roll:Charisma (<em>     </em>) + Acting (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:7
<p>Successes:1.   One person may be affected
<p>2. * . Two people
<p>3. * . Six people
<p>4. * . Up to 20 people
<p>5. * . 
All nearby - up to an auditorium full.
<p>Defenders:Defenders may spend Willpower to avoid the effects. One WP must be spent for
<p>each five minutes the defender spends in the presence of the user, until the effect wears off. Once the defender has spent WP equal to the 
number of successes gained by the user, he cannot be affected with this power by the user for the rest of the game.
<p>
<p><b>2. Dread Gaze
<p></b>Usually by staring the target in the eye whilst baring fangs and hissing, this causes the target to flee in fear, possibly for quite some time.
<p>User:Charisma (<em>     </em>) + Intimidation (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Defender:Wits + 5. (Wits + 3 for mortals, who are more easily frightened by this sort of thing)
<p>Successes:1.   They cower
<p>2. * . They leave your presence

<p>3. * . 
They run from your presence and put some distance between themselves and your location.
<p>4. * . 
Target leaves the area (i.e. may well leave the venue of the game) for a short while.
<p>5. * . 
They will leave the general location, and take several minutes to calm down. A target affected like this may well not be able to bring himself back into your presence for an hour or more.
<p>
<p><b>3. Entrancement
<p></b>The target of Entrancement will be enchanted with the user, and to an extent desire to serve their needs. The target may act unpredictably, depending on how they p
erceive the best course of action. This does not mean that the victim will give up personal secrets and the like for the user, and whilst they may stop any plans they have against the user, this will only happen for the duration of the effect.
<p>User:Appearance (<em>     </em>) + Empathy (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Defender:Willpower
<p>Successes:1.   Effect lasts 15 minutes
<p>2. * . Effect lasts 30 minutes

<p>3. * . 45 minutes
<p>4. * . 1 hour
<p>5. * . 1.5 hours
<p>
<p><b>Protean
<p></b>This allows the transformation of part or all of the body. Such transformations will affect small carried items and the vampire
s clothing, but larger objects will not be affected - ask a GM if in doubt.
<p>
<p><b>1. Gleam of Red Eyes
<p></b>Your eyes begin to faintly glow red, and you may see well in extreme darkness. You even have limited vision in pitch black. It takes 10 seconds to switch this power on or off. 
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b>2. Wolfs Claws
<p></b>You may grow inch-long claws on your fingers. The power takes ten seconds and one blood point to activate. These claws do not increase the damage you do (roll as norm
al on your standard unarmed (punch) skill and damage ratings), but any wounds you do cause count as aggravated, that is, they cannot be healed through the use of blood points. Use of this power is quite obvious, and if you retain your claws for some time 
you should mention their existence to people you are communicating with - unless you take pains to hide your hands.
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b>3. Earth Meld</b>
<p>You may sink into and merge with the earth, a good defence if caught outside at dawn for example. You may on
ly sink into earth - not stone or concrete or a wood-block floor! This limitation also precludes passing through such substances to reach soil - you must be standing on uncovered earth (turf probably counts as OK, though) to hide in this manner. While mel
ded, you are unaware of goings on on the surface above you. This power costs one blood point to activate.
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b>4. Shadow of the Beast
<p></b>At this level, full body transformation becomes possible. At a cost of one blood point you may become a wolf 
or a bat, over the course of thirty seconds. In an emergency, you can decrease the time needed to ten seconds, but the cost increases to three blood points. In the form you take, you will have all the natural abilities of the animal - a wolf
s improved sense of smell, a bats sonar (Bat-Finks Beep!) etc. In addition, most of your other Disciplines, will function (if in doubt, ask a GM).
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b>5. Form of Mist
<p></b>This remarkable power allows the vampire to completely vaporise into a thick mist - ap
pearing to just dissolve where he stands. This mist can travel at walking speed, and may pass through small openings such as keyholes and cracks under doors. Contrary to popular belief, the form is not broken up by high winds, but may be blown en-masse to
 a new location outside the vampire
s control. Although most disciplines may be used in this form, certain ones are precluded, most notably those requiring eye contact such as most of the Dominate powers. The change takes thirty seconds and costs one blood 
point, though the time can be reduced to ten seconds by using three blood points.
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b>Quietus</b>
<p>The assassination discipline of the Assamites has a variety of lethal effects<br> 
<p><b>1. Silence of Death
<p></b>On the activation of this discipline, all sound created within a 20
 radius is negated. The sound is not damped by the edges of the zone, it simply fails to be created at all. Note that sound created outside the zone can still be heard within it. Creation of the zone costs one Blood Point.
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b>2. Weakness
<p></b>
With a touch, and the expenditure of a Blood Point, the Assamite can lose the target one point of Stamina. If a Vampire is reduced to zero Stamina, he enters torpor. A Mortal is bedridden, and loses all immunity to disease.
<p>Attacker:Willpower
<p>Defender:Stamina + Fortitude (if any - Fortitude is a discipline).
<p>Successes:1.   Effect lasts 5 minutes
<p>2. * . Effect lasts 15 minutes

<p>3. * . 1 hour
<p>4. * . The rest of the evening

<p><b>
<p></b><b>3. Disease
<p></b>With a touch, and the expenditure of 3 Blood Points, the Assamite can lose 
the target one point each of Strength, Dexterity and Stamina. If a Vampire is reduced to zero Stamina, he enters torpor. A Mortal is bedridden, and loses all immunity to disease. If Strength or Dexterity are reduced to zero, the target cannot move.
<p>Attacker:Willpower
<p>Defender:Willpower
<p>Successes:1.   Effect lasts 5 minutes
<p>2. * . Effect lasts 15 minutes

<p>3. * . 1 hour
<p>4. * . The rest of the evening

<p>
<p><b>4. Blood Agony
<p></b>A weapon coated with the Assamites blood can cause aggravated wounds rather than normal damage. The weapon can b
e a sword or knife, or even fingernails. The number of Blood Points used in this power determines the number of physical hits the weapon can do as aggravated before the weapon needs recoating (e.g. If you use two blood points, you may hit for aggravated, 
then miss (using no points), then hit again as aggravated. Hits subsequent to the first two with the weapon would do normal damage again. Hits which fail to damage the target because the defender rolled well on their Damage Resistance still lose one point
 of blood coating).
<p>There is a maximum amount of blood which can be used on a weapon at once, examples are:
<p>Fist:One point (but you can do both hands).
<p>Knife:Two points.
<p>Sword:Three or four points depending on size.
<p>Should the weapon (particularly hands) be used for other purposes whilst coated, there is every possibility that the blood will wear off.
<p>
<p><b>5. Taste of Death
<p></b>A vampire with this power may actually spit blood at an opponent and cause aggravated damage. For every Blood point spent on the attack, t
he attacker adds 2 to the damage roll. The range of the attack is 10 feet for every point of Strength + Potence the user has.
<p>Attacker:Dexterity (<em>     </em>) + Firearms (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Defender:Dodge (derived stat), if they see it coming!
<p>Range:(Strength (<em>     </em>) + Potence (<em>     </em>)) x 10 =  [<em>       </em>] feet.
<p>Damage:2 x Blood Points Spent, Aggravated.
<p>
<p><b>Serpentis
<p></b>As far as is known, this discipline is known only to the Followers of Set and their Sabbat counterparts, the Serpents of the Light.
<p>
<p><b>1. The Eyes of the Serpent
<p></b>
The eyes of the Setite become gold with large black irises. Mortals find this strangely attractive, and if they meet the gaze of the user will be immobilised until the Setite breaks the gaze off. No roll is required to affect a mortal, but the effect can 
be avoided by not looking the serpent in the eyes in the first place. In order to affect a supernatural creature, an opposed roll is required:
<p>Attacker:Current Willpower.
<p>Defender:Current Willpower.
<p>
<p><b>2. Tongue of the Serpent
<p></b>The Setites tongue transforms into an 18 snake
s tongue. This may be used in combat and causes aggravated damage. If any damage is done by a strike, the next round the Setite may suck blood from the target as though he had bitten them.
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b>3. Mummify</b>
<p>In a few (about ten) seconds, a vampire with this power can assume an almost invulnerable form. The Vampire is incapable of any action, and is in a state similar to torpor, but can only be harmed by fire or sunlight. Revival is only possible at the taste 
of blood.
<p>No roll necessary.
<p>
<p><b>4. Form of the Serpent</b>
<p>The character may transform into a six foot black cobra, gaining advantages such as a poisonous (to mortals) bite and greatly enhanced sense of smell. The character may still use all disciplines (save those which require hands, such as Wolf
s Claws) whilst in the snake form, but is very hard of hearing. Use of this power normally requires assistance from a GM.
<p>Use of the power takes 30 seconds and costs one Blood Point.
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b>5. The Heart of Darkness
<p></b>
With several hours of (rather grisly) surgery, the Setite can remove his heart (or that of another) and place it in a small clay urn (or similar special container). This allows two advantages - the Vampire is stakeproof, and the difficulty of rolls to res
ist frenzy is reduced by two. The disadvantage is, of course, that the heart must be well guarded or hidden - while immune to most forms of damage, if it is exposed to fire or sunlight its owner will suffer a horrible death, and if it is staked the owner 
will immediately drop into torpor.
<p>No roll necessary.
<p>
<p>Thanatosis
<p>
<p><b>Thaumaturgy
<p></b>The blood magic of the Tremere has some potent powers. In addition to the raw discipline powers, knowledge of Thaumaturgy allows access to ritualised spells and specialised Paths.

<p>
<p><b>1. A Taste for Blood
<p></b>
If you have a sample of blood from a target, you may tell certain things about them. The blood must be fresh (i.e. liquid and not settled out), and you must physically touch it to get the effect. The details gained are the <i>current</i> s
tate of the target, not the state at which he was in when the blood was lost.
<p>Passive Roll:Perception (<em>     </em>) + Occult (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:7
<p>Successes:1.   How many Blood Points are in the target
<p>2. * . 
Above, plus how recently a vampiric target has fed
<p>3. * . 
Above, plus the approximate generation of the target
<p>Also, higher numbers allow more accurate information - the GM may well be quite
<p>vague when you only get one or two successes. Other information gained about other
<p>types of target (e.g. Lupines) is at the GMs discretion.
<p>
<p><b>2. Blood Rage
<p></b>The user may cause the target to expend blood points, in any way the attacker sees fit. A side effect of this is that the victim
s rolls to resist frenzy will increase by one for 15 minutes. Touch is required to operate this power, though the victim may take a few moments to notice he is (e.g.) suddenly much stronger and could well fail to realise why.
<p>Attacker:Dexterity (<em>     </em>) + Subterfuge (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Defender:Willpower.
<p>Successes:One blood point can be forced to be used for each success the attacker gets.
<p>
<p><b>3. Blood of Potency</b>
<p>This discipline allows the user to lower his effective generation for a time. Lower generation vampires can hold more blood points, spend blood faster, have higher trait maxima and are harder to Dominate. Each time this discipline is used, it costs the us
er Blood Points equal to the generation drop chosen (see below). Once the effect is running, it cannot be shortened or changed in any way, and the power cannot be used again until t
he old one has worn off. In any case, the power cannot be attempted more than once per hour.
<p>The roll for this discipline should always be done in the company of a GM, and should be done using the <i>original</i> Vampire rules (the GM will know how to handle this).
<p>Passive Roll:Manipulation (<em>     </em>) + Survival (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]   (Roll this many D10s)
<p>Difficulty:8 (i.e. Rolls of 8 or above are successes)
<p>Successes:Each success allows one generation drop for one hour. For example, if you gain
<p>three successes, and your original generation is 10th, you may opt to drop to 9th for
<p>three hours (costing one Blood Point), 8th for one and a half hours (costing two
<p>BPs), or 7th for one hour (costing three BPs). The minimum duration is one hour.
<p>
<p><b>4. Theft of Vitae
<p></b>
Allows you to steal blood from a target from a distance of up to 50 feet (the target must be I plain view). The blood leaves the target receptacle (pouring out of bodily orifices if the target is a being) and flies through the air to the Thaumaturgist, th
us making it obvious to all onlookers, as well as the target, what is going on! Blood taken in this way is absorbed into the users Blood Pool, and <i>cannot</i>
 be collected in a receptacle for later use. The user may bleed into a container for storage whilst using this discipline, but the Blood stored will be treated as his (for purposes of other blood magics etc.), not that of the target.
<p>Attacker:Intelligence (<em>     </em>) + Medicine (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Defender:Willpower. If target is a container, not a character, its effective WP is 5.
<p>Successes:One blood point can be stolen for each success the attacker gets.
<p>
<p><b>5. Cauldron of Blood</b>
<p>This particularly nasty power allows the user to boil the blood of a target by touch. If successful, this is almost invariably fatal to mortals. In vampires, one (non-aggravated) wound level is inflicted for each point boiled. In either case, the target l
oses the Blood Points boiled. The attacking vampire must choose how many points he wishes to boil <i>before</i> rolling for the attack.
<p>Attacker:Willpower.
<p>Defender:Number of points to boil (chosen by attacker) + 4.
<p>Successes:If the attacker succeeds, the chosen number of blood points are destroyed. If the
<p>defender wins (or draws) the roll, no damage is done.
<p>
<p><b>Vicissitude
<p></b>This is the discipline of the Tzimisce clan, allowing them to alter the form of their own bodies, as well as those of others.
<p>
<p><b>1. Changeling
<p></b>This power will only affect the user. It allows him to alter his own appearance on minor ways, such as altering the voice, the size of the no
se or the shape of the face. One Blood Point must be spent for each body part undergoing specific change. All changes are permanent unless reshaped using this discipline. An attempt at disguise or significant alteration may take a significant amount of ti
me.
<p>Passive Roll:Intelligence (<em>     </em>) + Body Alteration (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:7 (10 if attempting to improve appearance attribute).
<p>To Disguise:Intelligence (<em>     </em>) + Disguise (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:10
<p>Successes:1.   Flaws - needs distance and dim light.
<p>2. * . Better, but won
t work up close.
<p>3. * . 
May be a small flaw, not immediately noticeable.
<p>4. * . 
Good enough to fool all but close friends and family.
<p>5. * . 
Perfect, as long as the vampire acts the part well.
<p>
<p><b>2. Fleshcraft
<p></b>This allows more drastic alteration of the users or another
s flesh. This is achieved by actually moulding the flesh as though it were clay. Again, the effects are permanent. An unwilling victim must be grappled before this power can be used. This costs the same in Blood as Changeling abov
e, and uses the same disguise success chart.
<p>Passive Roll:Dexterity (<em>     </em>) + Body Alteration (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:7
<p>
<p><b>3. Bonecraft
<p></b>As fleshcraft, but works on the targets bones. If not used in conjunction with Fleshcraft, the altered bones may puncture or rip skin and muscle, causing extreme pain and disfigurement.
<p>Passive Roll:Strength (<em>     </em>) + Body Alteration (<em>     </em>) =  [<em>     </em>]
<p>Difficulty:7
<p>Successes:If used to cause damage, make a damage roll adding the number of successes gained
<p>from the original Bonecraft roll as the modifier.
<p>
<p><b>4. Horrid Form
<p></b>The vampire may transform into a real monster, resembling the Alien from Ridley Scott
s film! Claws, black skin, bony ridges and an oily black slime are the primary features of the 8 foot tall beast. The form costs two blood points to assume, and confers 
the following effects: All physical stats increase by three, and all social attributes drop to zero. Hand to hand damage (in addition to the bonus for increased strength) gets a bonus of +1, though it is <i>not</i> classed as aggravated.
<p>No roll required.
<p>
<p><b><em>Appendix B: Thaumaturgic Paths
<p></b></em>
<p>(Some words here, obviously!)
<p>
<p><b><em>Appendix C: Thaumaturgic Rituals
<p></b></em>
<p>
<p><b>1  Blood of Peace (Clanbook: Assamite)
<p></b>
This ritual involves two points of Assamite blood (one to be enchanted, one to be used to enchant the other). This ritual turns Assamite blood into a strong tranquilliser, that may be swallowed, or applied to the skin. A Willpower roll may be made to resi
st the effects, difficulty the Intelligence + Science of the caster.
<p>
<p><b>1  Blood Rush (Sabbat)
<p></b>The vampire may make herself feel as though she has fed, even if she hasnt. This may be used for pleasure, or to curb thirst-related frenzy. Lasts one hour.
<p>
<p><b>1  Communicate with Kindred Sire
<p></b>
This ritual involves possessing an object belonging to the Sire, and takes five minutes. The vampire may speak with her sire, telepathically (this does not facilitate mindreading). Variations of this ritual exist to allow telepathic communication between 
ones thralls, progeny, or those who have tasted the casters blood.
<p>
<p><b>1  Defence of the Sacred Haven
<p></b>
This ritual takes an hour to perform, and uses up one blood point. The vampire may put a drop of her blood on each window in an area, up to twenty feet away from the ritual site. All sunlight that would go in through these windows is instead reflected by 
them. This ritual lasts as long as the vampire is in the area.
<p>
<p><b>1  Deflection of Wooden Doom
<p></b>This ritual involves standing in a circle of wood, and putting a splinter in ones mouth. One wooden melee weapon that is about to penetrate the vampire
s heart will instead disintegrate. A weapon that is only held threateningly, without the intent to stab the vampire, will not be affected. Lasts until sunset, or until it affects a weapon.
<p>
<p><b>1  Devils Touch
<p></b>This ritual must be cast in the presence of its victim, and involves putting a coin on her person. The vampire can make all other mortals react to a mortal victim with hostility. Lasts one night.
<p>
<p><b>1  Domino of Life (Sabbat)
<p></b>The vampire may simulate one human trait. Any trait, from the warmth of human flesh, to tears, can be assumed. Lasts one night.
<p>
<p><b>1  Engaging the Vessel of Transference
<p></b>
This ritual involves putting blood in a container, sealing it, and engraving a rune on it, and takes three hours. This container will take some blood from, and empty its current load into, anyone who touches it, who will only feel a shiver. If the rune is
 not covered, a roll of Intelligence + Occult, difficulty 8, will reveal it to read "change blood". This container will act as described, again and again, until broken open.
<p>
<p><b>1  Illuminate Trail of the Prey (Sabbat)
<p></b>The vampire may make the trail of a specific victim glow in such a way that only she can see it. All paths, from an aeroplane
s vapour trails to footprints, will be shown. A starting point is required, as is an initial sighting of the victim, and the spell is nullified if the vampire wades in or is immersed in water.
<p>
<p><b>1  Incantation of the Shepherd
<p></b>This ritual involves holding glass over each of one
s eyes, and turning slowly, for fifteen minutes. The vampire may locate each vessel of her herd, starting with the closest and working outward. She must have tasted a vessel at least once for this to work.
<p>
<p><b>1  Preserve Blood (Sabbat)
<p></b>
This ritual involves burying an earthenware container for three nights. Blood may be preserved in such a container by putting in a little burdock, reciting a few incantations, and sealing it with wax. This blood will be preserved until the container is br
oken or opened. This container can not be used twice with the same blood.
<p>
<p><b>1  Preserve Corpse (Black Hand)
<p></b>
The vampire may create, from a mixture of decaying organic matter and herbs, a liquid that, once poured on a corpse, will preserve it. This ritual produces enough of this material to cover a large corpse. The liquid will last indefinitely once applied, bu
t will lose its potency within a week if not used before then.
<p>
<p><b>1  Purity of Flesh
<p></b>This ritual involves concentrating for ten minutes in a lotus position, surrounded by t
hirteen sharp stones, and then spending a blood point. This ritual will remove all foreign matter from the vampire, good or bad. (This includes fake limbs, breast implants, surgical appliances, poisons, drugs, wooden splinters, etc.) This also affects mat
ter touching her, and those performing this ritual would be advised to do it in the nude.
<p>
<p><b>1  Rebirth of Mortal Vanity
<p></b>This ritual requires strands of hair from mortal children, and involves gesturing in front of a mirror for an hour. This ritual causes the vampire
s hair to grow one inch for each child from whom hair was taken and used. This hair will remain until cut. If the vampire wishes to perform this ritual for another, she must also be in front of the mirror.
<p>
<p><b>1  Rite of Introduction
<p></b>
This ritual involves reciting a half-hour incantation, and then speaking into water vapour. The vampire may contact the Regent of the nearest Tremere Chantry first, and then others, descending the hierarchy. By tradition, only the Regent is bound to answe
r, and a brief dialogue with each person is possible. Used often to announce ones presence, or to call for help.
<p>
<p><b>1  Wake with Evenings Freshness
<p></b>
This ritual takes a half-hour to perform, and involves burning feathers, and spreading the ashes over the sleeping area. The vampire who performs this ritual may awaken at the slightest sign of danger, and the rules involving Humanity, regarding the abili
ty to awaken and remain awake, are waived for the first few turns. Lasts until sunset.
<p>
<p><b>1  Will o the Wisp (Sabbat)

<p>
This one-year ritual involves allowing a large diamond to absorb a day of sunlight, engraving symbols on it, and swallowing it. The vampire who performs this ritual is invulnerable to sunlight, fire, etc., for one year per success, at the end of which tim
e, the diamond has fully dissolved. The vampire can also remain awake during the day, for a number of hours determined by rolling Humanity + Fortitude, difficulty dependent on time of day. Those who drink the vampire
s blood will share these traits for one hour per blood point imbibed.

This section details the ways in which creatures other than vampires differ from the Kindred. This is purely a mechanical breakdown of the differences, describing what rules alterations are needed to cope with suc
h entities, and some hints on how they should be utilised in a game. What is not covered is a detailed discussion of the motivations and cultures of the new beings - it is up to the GM utilising such creatures to bone up on such background.

This is elsewhere, or was not in Chris's copy of the guide, but isn't really relevant anyway.
