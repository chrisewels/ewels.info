Doctor Jones leaned forward in the dim light, peering at the script.
A young boy held a lamp, and as he fidgetted the light flickered
eerily over the temple walls.  Suddenly he froze as he saw a snake
creeping up the doctor's chair leg.  "Doctor Jones!" he cried
urgently, "Doctor Jones!" "Be quiet", snapped the Doctor irritably,
"Can't you see I'm trying to read my email?"
<p>
Maybe that's an exaggeration, but how far along the backpacking trail
has email encroached?  On the edge of Chitwan National Park in Nepal
nestles the small village of XX.  At night Rhinos cross the river from
the jungle to eat the villagers crops, and have to be driven away with
burning branches.  But by day you can sit down in their Cybercafe with
a cup of tea and check your email.  Relaxing at the end of the day in
the small Indian fishing village of Varkala, you can sit on the cliffs
and watch the lights of the fishing boats bob in the darkness as they
draw in their catch of squid.  But it's possible you might miss this
if you're down the road in the internet cafe, surfing the Web.
<p>
Just as a few years ago there as an explosion of new international
phones across the Indian subcontinent, the same is now happening with
internet cafes.  The first places to get wired have all been those
that are popular amongst the backpackers, and although there are still
one or two towns such as Darjeeling with no good internet link, by the
time you read this they should also have a cybercafe or two to their
name.  The spread of the Internet also extends all the way down
through South East Asia.  The neon signs on Khao San Road in Bangkok
advertising Tatoos and Banana Pancakes are being jostled for position
beside freshly painted adverts for "Email, Fax, Internet". If you make
a friend on the trail and swap addresses, the chances are they'll be
email addresses.  Wherever you travel these days, it seems you're not
far from the Internet.
<p>
So how do you go about using the Internet, and more importantly, why
should you bother?  There are two things that the internet is really
useful for: Sending and receiving email, and browsing the World Wide
Web for information.  Whereas the world wide web is mainly useful for
researching your trip before you go, email acts as a cheap and
flexible alternative to phonecalls and letters.  To use email all you
need is an address, which acts as an electronic postbox and stores up
any messages you've been sent.  Then whenever you pop into a Cybercafe
you can read through the messages, write replies, and send out new
messages.
<p>
So what are the advantages of using email over more traditional ways
of staying in touch such as letters or the telephone?  Firstly it's
fast; a letter sent by post can take weeks to arrive, whereas an email
is usually there in seconds.  Compared to phone calls it's generally
very cheap.  To phone the UK from Kathmandu for a minute costs around
[pound sign]1.40, whereas using the internet for the same time costs
between 6 and 12 pence.  You can now get an email address for free
from a number of commercial Web sites (such as www.hotmail.com or
www.yahoo.com).  This normally takes around half an hour to arrange,
and any of the Cybercafes should be able to show you how to do it.
Alternatively you can set it up before you leave, as many local
libraries offer cheap internet access.
<p>
There's also many other bonuses with email.  The people you write to
can keep your messages and read them as many times as they want, and
if you're not keeping a diary it can be a nice record when you get
back.  If you've got lots of friends on email then it's easy to write
one message with all your news and send copies of it to all of them.
When you're meant to be out enjoying yourself it's a lot quicker than
writing a hundred duplicate postcards!
<p>
Email also comes into its own when keeping in touch with fellow
travellers.  It's frustrating to make friends on the trail and then
lose contact when you head off in different directions.  Notice boards
in travellers cafes are covered in messages ("I was at the Taj Mahal
on May 12th as arranged, where were you?") and if you're not careful
you can end up following each other's paper trails round the country.
Email removes all of these problems in one go ("Train strike in
Hyderabad, I'm stuck here until the 14th, sorry!").  Email is never
going to completely replace phone calls and letters - there's nothing
like hearing a voice from home - but used together they make it much
easier to stay in touch.
<p>
So if you're currently planning your travels, how can the World Wide
Web help you?  There's a gold mine of information for backpackers on
the Web if you know where to look.  The first place to start is our
STA Web site (www.statravel.co.uk).  It's full of info on places to go
and things to see, as well as suggestions and recommendations on the
best ways to get around.  Try "Traveltalk" where travel tips are sent
in by other backpackers, or use the Globetrotter section to plan out a
route and get a feel for the prices.  If you're not sure where to go,
or even what's out there, then this is definitely the place to start.

you need it; search.excite.com, when given the words "Malaysia" and

Finally there's one more thing the internet can be good for.  Waiting
at the end of many trips is that dreaded time when you have to start
thinking about getting a job again.  With the internet you can start
hunting before you get home, and email means you can even start
applying for things if you're keen.  There's no question that the
internet can make a big difference to your travel, both when planning
and when you're out there.  As well as making travelling more secure
it definitely makes the world a smaller place; whether that's a good
thing or not is a matter of personal choice.  If you use email as a
life-line or it's one of the aspects of home life you're travelling to
escape, don't be surprised if you stagger down a Himalayan mountain
trail looking for a large glass of Chang, only to find yourself being
served in a Cybercafe!
